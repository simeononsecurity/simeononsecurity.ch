As the Brave Browser is build off of Chromium, it should support most, if not all, the same policies from the Chromium and Google Chrome ADMX templates. With that in mind, we&amp;rsquo;ve modified the Google Chrome ADMX templates to reflect the Brave Browser&amp;rsquo;s registry path. After some initial troubleshooting and testing, the templatates seem to work.</description></item><item><title>Chromium ADMX Templates</title><link>/github/chromium-admx-templates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 19:30:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>/github/chromium-admx-templates/</guid><description>ChromiumADMX Proper ADMX Template for the Chromium Browser
Brave, as a company, has failed to release ADMX templates for the Chromium Browser that may be installed at the same time as the Google Chrome templates. With that in mind, we&amp;rsquo;ve modified the Google Chrome ADMX templates to reflect the Chromium Browser&amp;rsquo;s registry path and placed in tandum in the Google ADMX Folder in GPO.
These Policy Definitions are in a Pre-Alpha state.</description></item><item><title>Optimize, Harden, and Debloat Windows 10 Deployments</title><link>/github/optimizing-and-hardening-windows10-deployments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 20:15:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>/github/optimizing-and-hardening-windows10-deployments/</guid><description>Optimize, Harden, and Debloat Windows 10 Deployments Download all the required files from the GitHub Repository
We are seeking help with the following .Net issue
Introduction: Windows 10 is an invasive and insecure operating system out of the box. Organizations like PrivacyTools.io, Microsoft, Cyber.mil, the Department of Defense, and the National Security Agency have recommended configuration changes to lockdown, harden, and secure the operating system. These changes cover a wide range of mitigations including blocking telemetry, macros, removing bloatware, and preventing many digital and physical attacks on a system.</description></item><item><title>Automating Windows Updates with Chocolatey, PSWindowsUpdate, and Startup Scripts</title><link>/github/automating-windows-updates-with-chocolatey-pswindowsupdate-and-startup-scripts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 17:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/github/automating-windows-updates-with-chocolatey-pswindowsupdate-and-startup-scripts/</guid><description>Automating Windows Updates with Chocolatey, PSWindowsUpdate, and Startup Scripts Download all supporting files from the GitHub Repository
 In today&amp;rsquo;s modern workplace environment, system administrators constantly are battling for time. Rolling out the latest Windows updates can be extremely time consuming taking up to a week given enough systems. Along with some assistance from Chocolatey, PSWindowsUpdates, and Startup Scripts, Systems Administrators can roll out update with as little as a single reboot of each machine.</description></item><item><title>Windows Spectre Meltdown Mitigation Script</title><link>/github/windows-spectre-meltdown-mitigation-script/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/github/windows-spectre-meltdown-mitigation-script/</guid><description>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073119/protect-against-speculative-execution-side-channel-vulnerabilities-in Simple script to implement protections against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
Microsoft is aware of a new publicly disclosed class of vulnerabilities that are called “speculative execution side-channel attacks” and that affect many modern processors including Intel, AMD, VIA, and ARM.
Note: This issue also affects other operating systems, such as Android, Chrome, iOS, and macOS. Therefore, we advise customers to seek guidance from those vendors.
We have released several updates to help mitigate these vulnerabilities.</description></item><item><title/><link>/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/guides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>What is SimeonOnSecurity?
