These recommendations do not take into account vendors privacy policies or related practices and only cover the AV capabilities, detection, user experience, and performance.
Notes:
Generally speaking, AV is not required on Linux or MacOS. It is not recommended to use any VPN or password manager thay may be provided with the AV suite.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Books</title><link>/recommendations/books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/recommendations/books/</guid><description>Educational: Automation: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Al Sweigart Practical Ansible 2 - Daniel Oh Practical Network Automation - Abhishek Ratan Coding: Python Crash Course - Eric Matthes Cyber Security: Blue Team Field Manual - Alan J White Hash Crack - Joshua Picolet Operator Handbook - Joshua Picolet Red Team Field Manual - Ben Clark The Art of Deception - Kevin Mitnick The Art of Intrusion - Kevin Mitnick The Art of Invisibility - Kevin Mitnick The Hacker Playbook 3 - Peter Kim Tribe of Hackers - Marcus J.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Browser Plugins</title><link>/recommendations/browser_plugins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/recommendations/browser_plugins/</guid><description>Note: The only daily-driver browser I recommend is FireFox. Alternatively you should be using the TOR Browser. Do not install plugins in the TOR browser.

Some will enable you to land a job, while others wont. This list consists of the certifications that SimeonOnSecurity recommends for those seeking to enter the IT and CyberSecurity job force.
Notes:
This should apply everywhere in the US, but outside the US these are likely to change. There may be other certs out there that are worth in a specific category that aren&amp;rsquo;t listed here, but the ones here are listed over others because they have the widest recognition.</description></item><item><title>Recommended eMail Providers</title><link>/recommendations/email/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/recommendations/email/</guid><description> ProtonMail - Preferred - E2E Encrypted EMail

Our privacy is being abused by governments (with mass-surveillance), corporations (profiting from selling personal data), and cyber criminals (stealing our poorly-secured personal data and using it against us). Security is needed in order to keep your private data private, and good digital security is critical to stay protected from the growing risks associated with the war on data.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Security Content Creators</title><link>/recommendations/creators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/recommendations/creators/</guid><description>Note: Check out SecurityCreators if you like this page.
