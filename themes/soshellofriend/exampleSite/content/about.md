<h2>> Hi there<span class="logo__cursor" style="width: 3px; height: 1.625rem;"></span></h2>

My name is Radek and I'm the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.
 
We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.
 
This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!
 
The theme includes:
 
- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- an easy way to modify the theme (**Webpack, NodeJS, PostCSS** — initial setup created by [Marcin Dziewulski](http://www.mobily.pl))
 
So, there you have it... enjoy!
