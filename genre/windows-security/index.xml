What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and automation using Ansible.
First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Windows_STIG_Ansible repository provides a complete solution for configuring Windows systems to meet Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, using the Ansible automation platform. The windows_stigs repository is a collection of Ansible roles for configuring Windows systems to meet STIG requirements, and it is available on Ansible Galaxy, a central repository for sharing Ansible content.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learned about Auditpol, Sysmon, and Sysmon Configurations</title><link>https://dev.simeononsecurity.ch/til/2021-05-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SimeonOnSecurity</dc:creator><category>

What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
Today, SimeonOnSecurity delved into the topic of auditing and enforcing Windows Defender Application Control WDAC policies. WDAC is a feature in Windows that helps to prevent unauthorized or untrusted software from running on a device. It provides a means of controlling which applications can run on a device, thereby helping to improve the overall security of the device.
Auditing and Enforcing Windows Defender Application Control WDAC Policies: # Microsoft - Audit Windows Defender Application Control Policies Microsoft - Deploy Windows Defender Application Control policies by using Group Policy Microsoft - Deploy Windows Defender Application Control policies by using Microsoft Intune Microsoft - Enforce Windows Defencer Application Control Policies Updated Repos: # SimeonOnSecurity - Windows-Defender-Application-Control-Hardening Videos of Interest: # Disrupt - Earth&amp;rsquo;s Deadliest Computer Virus John Hammond - How to move FAST in the Linux Terminal Microsoft 365 - Microsoft Defender Application Control ShortCircuit - My Dongle is HUGE!</description></item></channel></rss>
