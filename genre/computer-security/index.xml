&lt;p>&lt;strong>What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SimeonOnSecurity recently learned about two topics in the field of computer security: CVE-2020-17049, also known as the Kerberos Bronze Bit Attack, and Windows Token-Based Activation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kerberos Bronze Bit Attack, as explained in a series of blog posts by Netspi and in a post by Trimarcsecurity, is a vulnerability in the Kerberos authentication protocol. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to compromise an Active Directory, which is a central repository for information about an organization&amp;rsquo;s users, computers, and other resources. The deployment of Kerberos S4U changes to address this vulnerability is discussed in a Microsoft support article.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
