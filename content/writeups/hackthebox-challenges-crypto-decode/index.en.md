Get a detailed walk-through of the HackTheBox Crypto Decode challenge. Given two strings of information, this article guides you through the process of decoding a Fernet cypher and a Malboge cipher to reveal the flag. Utilize tools provided by asecuritysite.com and base64decode.org to achieve the solution.

## Walk Through:

At first glance it appears this is some sort of key and some cipher text.
After searching around, you'll find that it is a Fernet cypher.
[Asecuritysite.com](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ferdecode) has a great tool to decode it for you.

The plain text from the above information gives you a base64 encoded string

```

To decode this, we'll use the tool provided from [base64decode.org](https://www.base64decode.org/)

Decoding again gives you the following:

```

This was a new one for me. But you'll find after some careful research that it is a Malboge cipher.
Decoding it with [this](http://malbolge.doleczek.pl/) tool will give you the flag.

### Flag Ex:
```
HTB{x_xxx_xxxx}
```
