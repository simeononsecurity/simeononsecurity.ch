**Discussing Body Hacking and My Experience with Dangerous Things NFC Tags**

## Introduction

Body hacking has been a fascinating journey for me, as I sought to enhance my body with technological advancements. One particular aspect of body hacking that caught my interest was the use of **Dangerous Things NFC tags**. These tags allow individuals to interact with digital devices and access information through a simple touch. However, my personal experience has taught me valuable lessons about the potential risks and complications associated with these implants. In this article, I will share my journey and emphasize the importance of understanding the risks involved in body modifications.

## My Story: Encountering Issues with NFC Tag Implant

Five years ago, I decided to have an NFC tag implant. The procedure was done in my dominant hand, following a **sterile process** to minimize the risk of infection. Initially, everything seemed fine, but around two years after the implantation, I started experiencing problems. To my dismay, my body began to reject the implant, causing inflammation, **severe pain**, and even potential nerve damage. This unexpected turn of events made me realize the gravity of the risks associated with these implants. Body modifications are not for the faint-hearted, and it is crucial to heed the warnings about the potential dangers they pose.

I truly loved the idea of having an NFC tag implant and enjoyed the small benefits it provided, such as engaging in cool NFC projects. However, as the pain and risks increased, I came to the realization that nothing is worth the potential loss of my hand or the risk of acquiring a serious infection like MRSA. Consequently, I am currently working with a surgeon to have the implant removed. Through my experiences and the risks I have now fully understood, I cannot recommend the purchase and use of these devices, no matter how well-trained the professional is who installs them. It is important to recognize that body modifications come with significant risks.

## Understanding the Complications

The onset of pain occurred approximately two years after the implantation, despite not engaging in physically demanding activities that could have caused damage to the implant. However, I noticed that the implant had gradually shifted closer to the bones in my hand, specifically between the base of my hand (palm) and the thumb and pointer finger. This change in position led to the emergence of issues. Initially, I attributed the symptoms to carpal tunnel syndrome and tried various remedies, including ergonomics, creams, and anti-inflammatory treatments. Unfortunately, these efforts proved futile. It became evident that the pain was growing, albeit not constant, and reaching a level that demanded attention. To confirm the movement of the implant, I underwent an X-ray, which revealed its displacement. Prior to the X-ray, I had also used an NFC reader to confirm the shift.

Living with chronic pain is no laughing matter. Even the smallest discomforts can become aggravating and significantly impact mood and overall well-being. I am hopeful that after the removal of the implant, the pain will subside. Chronic pain has taught me the importance of taking these matters seriously and seeking appropriate solutions to mitigate its effects.

## Conclusion and Cautionary Note

My personal journey with an NFC tag implant has shed light on the critical importance of understanding the risks associated with body modifications. While these implants offer the potential for convenience and enhanced interaction with digital devices, it is crucial to approach them with caution.

When considering NFC tag implants or any form of body hacking, conducting thorough research and consulting with professionals is paramount. Understanding the potential complications and carefully weighing the risks against the benefits are essential steps in making an informed decision. Personal safety and well-being should always be the top priority. It is imperative to acknowledge that body modifications carry significant risks that can have long-lasting consequences.
