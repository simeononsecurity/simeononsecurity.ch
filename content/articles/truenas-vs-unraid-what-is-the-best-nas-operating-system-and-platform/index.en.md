When it comes to **building a network-attached storage (NAS) system, two of the most well-known operating systems for x86-based computers are TrueNas and Unraid**. Both provide powerful features for managing a NAS system, but their primary difference lies in their method for storage management.

In this article, we will compare TrueNas and Unraid to assist you in making the best decision for your needs.

## Overview of Unraid

**Unraid is a proprietary NAS operating system developed by Lime Technology**, a software company located in California. It was established in 2005 and runs on the Linux platform. The goal of Unraid is to make RAID technology more accessible by eliminating restrictions on disk size, speed, brand, and protocol. This allows for easy expansion of RAID arrays and minimizes the risk of data loss.

## Introduction to TrueNas

**TrueNas, previously known as FreeNas, is an open-source NAS operating system developed by iXsystems**, a private company based in San Jose, California. It was launched in 2005 and is built on FreeBSD and Linux. TrueNas developers concentrate on the enterprise market and its choice of the default file system (OpenZFS) reflects this focus.

## Cost

Home users who are searching for the best NAS operating system often have concerns about **cost**. In this regard, **TrueNas** is a clear winner as it is **open-source and completely free**[^1][^2], at least for TrueNas CORE, the version aimed at home users and non-critical storage applications.

In contrast, **Unraid** is not free but uses a fair pricing model with no subscriptions or hidden fees[^3]. There are three Unraid plans to choose from, each differing only in the number of storage devices that can be attached. The **Basic plan** costs **$59**[^4], the **Plus plan** costs **$89**[^5], and the **Pro plan** costs **$129**[^6].

## User-Friendliness

When it comes to **user-friendliness**, **Unraid** excels with its emphasis on **ease of use and flexibility**[^1]. It offers a unique storage management system that allows users to **mix and match different disk sizes and types**[^2]. Adding or removing disks can be done without any interruption to the system[^2]. Unraid's **straightforward and simple user interface** makes it accessible even for non-technical users[^3].

On the other hand, **TrueNas** is primarily **geared towards the enterprise market** and requires more advanced knowledge to set up and manage[^4]. Its use of the **OpenZFS file system** brings advanced data protection features like **snapshots, data compression, and checksumming** to ensure data integrity[^5]. While TrueNas offers robust features, it may require a higher level of technical expertise to fully utilize its capabilities.

## Features

**Both TrueNas and Unraid** provide support for **NFS shares**, **SMB** for Windows, and **AFP** for macOS and iOS[^1][^2]. **TrueNas** goes a step further by offering additional services like **iSCSI**, **LDAP**, **Active Directory**, and **Kerberos**[^1]. **Unraid**, on the other hand, distinguishes itself with its support for **Docker containers**, providing users access to a wide range of applications[^2].

**TrueNas** stands out with its built-in support for **cloud storage services** such as **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure**[^1]. Moving data to the cloud becomes seamless with TrueNas. While **Unraid** doesn't have native support for cloud storage, users can explore third-party solutions, which may require additional setup and configuration[^2].

The Linux-based platform of **Unraid** allows for **virtual machine configuration** using **KVM** and the assignment of **PCI/USB devices** to virtual machines, including graphics cards, enabling users to utilize the same computer for media center and gaming purposes[^2].

**TrueNas** offers its own containerization technology called **Jails** and its own virtualization option called **Bhyve**[^1]. While it provides many popular third-party applications like **Plex**, the overall software selection may be more limited compared to Unraid[^1].
