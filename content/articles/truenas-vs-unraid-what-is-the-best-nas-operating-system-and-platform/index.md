# Unraid vs TrueNas: Which NAS Operating System is Right for You?

When it comes to building a network-attached storage (NAS) system, two of the most well-known operating systems for x86-based computers are TrueNas and Unraid. Both provide powerful features for managing a NAS system, but their primary difference lies in their method for storage management.

In this article, we will compare TrueNas and Unraid to assist you in making the best decision for your needs.

## Overview of Unraid

Unraid is a proprietary NAS operating system developed by Lime Technology, a software company located in California. It was established in 2005 and runs on the Linux platform. The goal of Unraid is to make RAID technology more accessible by eliminating restrictions on disk size, speed, brand, and protocol. This allows for easy expansion of RAID arrays and minimizes the risk of data loss.

## Introduction to TrueNas

TrueNas, previously known as FreeNas, is an open-source NAS operating system developed by iXsystems, a private company based in San Jose, California. It was launched in 2005 and is built on FreeBSD and Linux. TrueNas developers concentrate on the enterprise market and its choice of the default file system (OpenZFS) reflects this focus.

## Cost

Home users who are searching for the best NAS operating system often have concerns about cost. In this regard, TrueNas is a clear winner as it is open-source and completely free, at least for TrueNas CORE, the version aimed at home users and non-critical storage applications.

In contrast, Unraid is not free but uses a fair pricing model with no subscriptions or hidden fees. There are three Unraid plans to choose from, each differing only in the number of storage devices that can be attached. The Basic plan costs $59, the Plus plan costs $89, and the Pro plan costs $129.

## User-Friendliness

Unraid places a strong emphasis on ease of use and flexibility. It has a unique storage management system that enables users to mix and match different disk sizes and types and add or remove disks without any interruption. It also offers a straightforward and simple user interface, making it easy for even non-technical users to set up and manage a NAS system.

TrueNas, on the other hand, is geared towards the enterprise market and requires more advanced knowledge to set up and manage. Its choice of the OpenZFS file system provides advanced data protection features such as snapshots, data compression, and checksumming to ensure data integrity.

## Features

Both TrueNas and Unraid offer support for NFS shares, SMB for Windows, and AFP for macOS and iOS. In addition, TrueNas provides iSCSI services, LDAP, Active Directory, and Kerberos. Unraid does not offer these services, but it does support Docker containers, giving users access to a wide variety of applications.

TrueNas also has built-in support for cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, making it easy to move data to the cloud. Unraid users can use third-party solutions, but they may require additional setup and configuration.

Unraid's Linux-based platform also enables virtual machine configuration using KVM and assigning PCI/USB devices, such as graphics cards, to virtual machines. This makes it possible to use the same computer for both media center and gaming purposes.

TrueNas includes its own containerization technology, Jails, and its own virtualization option, Bhyve. While TrueNas offers many of the popular third-party applications, such as Plex, the overall selection of software may be smaller compared to Unraid.

## Documentation and Community

TrueNas has a comprehensive Documentation Hub, covering everything from setup to APIs and hardware platforms. The Unraid website has a less extensive documentation section, but it is easier to navigate. However, Unraid does not have an individual support page, but users are encouraged to ask questions on the official community forum, which is described as friendly, informative, and helpful.

TrueNas also has its own official community forum, but it may not be as welcoming to beginners as the Unraid forum. This is because many TrueNas users are IT professionals focused on enterprise storage management.

## Conclusion

Both TrueNas and Unraid are powerful and mature NAS operating systems, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. TrueNas is ideal for those with advanced knowledge of storage management and who want the advanced data protection features of OpenZFS. Unraid, on the other hand, is best for home users who want a flexible and easy-to-use NAS system.

In summary:

**TrueNas Pros:**
- Free and open-source
- Advanced data protection with OpenZFS
- Great performance

**TrueNas Cons:**
- More difficult to use
- Unfriendly community

**Unraid Pros:**
- Easy to use
- Wide variety of third-party applications
- Friendly community

**Unraid Cons:**
- Limited performance

Ultimately, the decision between TrueNas and Unraid will come down to your specific needs and level of technical expertise. Consider your requirements, compare the features and benefits of each, and make an informed decision.
