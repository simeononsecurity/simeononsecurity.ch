**The Art of Incident Response: Best Practices and Real-World Examples**

Incident response is a critical component of an organization's cybersecurity posture. Effective incident response can help organizations minimize the impact of security incidents and reduce recovery time. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a framework for incident response, known as NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2. In this article, we will discuss the best practices for incident response according to NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 and suggest some improvements to the standard.

## Best Practices for Incident Response

NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 provides a framework for incident response that consists of four phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. The following are some best practices for each phase of the incident response process:

### Preparation Phase

- Develop an incident response plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, procedures for reporting and handling incidents, and communication channels with external parties.
- Train and educate the incident response team on the incident response plan, including the procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to incidents.
- Develop and maintain a list of critical assets and data, including their location, ownership, and sensitivity level.

### Detection and Analysis Phase

- Monitor the network and systems for suspicious activity and anomalies.
- Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and prevent attacks.
- Investigate suspicious activity to determine whether it is a legitimate incident.

### Containment Phase

- Isolate the affected systems and networks to prevent the incident from spreading.
- Collect and preserve evidence for analysis and potential legal proceedings.
- Identify and contain the root cause of the incident.

### Eradication and Recovery Phase

- Remove the malware or other malicious code from affected systems.
- Restore systems and data from backups.
- Patch vulnerabilities that were exploited in the incident.

## Improvements to NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2

While NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 provides a useful framework for incident response, there are some areas where it could be improved. The following are some suggested improvements:

### 1. Incorporate threat intelligence

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, organizations must stay one step ahead of threat actors. Incorporating **threat intelligence** into incident response processes is a proactive strategy to detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents effectively.

Threat intelligence involves gathering and analyzing information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors. This invaluable data is sourced from diverse channels, including **open-source intelligence**, **dark web forums**, and **commercial threat intelligence feeds**. By leveraging this intelligence, organizations can bolster their incident response capabilities.

One of the primary benefits of incorporating threat intelligence is the ability to proactively detect and prevent threats. For instance, if a threat actor is known for employing a specific type of malware or exploit, threat intelligence enables organizations to identify and counteract these threats before they inflict damage. By staying informed about **indicators of compromise (IOCs)**, organizations can swiftly respond to security incidents.

There are multiple approaches for integrating threat intelligence into incident response processes. Organizations can subscribe to **commercial threat intelligence feeds** that provide real-time information about known threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, leveraging **open-source intelligence** enables organizations to gather insights into threat actors and their TTPs. For a more automated approach, organizations can utilize **threat intelligence platforms** that streamline the gathering and analysis of threat intelligence.

For example, the notorious cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 showcased the significance of threat intelligence. The attack, attributed to the threat actor SandWorm, employed custom malware targeting industrial control systems (ICS). Although SandWorm was previously unknown, cybersecurity researchers analyzed the attack and identified **IOCs** to detect and mitigate future attacks by this threat actor.

Furthermore, the integration of threat intelligence in incident response processes contributes to long-term cybersecurity improvement. Through analysis and identification of patterns and trends, organizations can identify vulnerabilities in their security infrastructure and fortify their defenses accordingly.

Incorporating threat intelligence into incident response processes empowers organizations to proactively defend against emerging threats, enhance incident detection and response capabilities, and continually improve their cybersecurity posture.
### 2. Emphasize the importance of communication

**Effective communication** is a vital component of a successful incident response strategy. To ensure a cohesive and well-coordinated response, organizations must establish **communication channels** and procedures in advance, facilitating timely updates and information sharing among stakeholders.

The **incident response plan** serves as a guide, outlining the communication framework during an incident. It designates responsible individuals for communicating with both internal and external stakeholders, such as **senior management**, **legal counsel**, **law enforcement**, and **customers**. Regular and informative updates are provided to keep stakeholders informed, enabling them to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.

For instance, in the case of a **ransomware attack**, effective communication plays a crucial role in orchestrating the response efforts. Internal communication within the incident response team ensures the dissemination of up-to-date information and alignment towards a common objective. External communication with senior management is vital for conveying the incident's impact on the organization and providing necessary updates. Collaborating with **law enforcement** facilitates incident reporting and obtaining expert guidance.

Furthermore, the incident response plan emphasizes the importance of **documenting** all communication related to the incident. Logs of phone calls, emails, and other forms of communication serve as valuable records. Additionally, decisions made during the incident response process are documented, enabling transparency and accountability.

Effective communication extends beyond the incident response process to the post-incident analysis phase. Stakeholders are informed of the **lessons learned** from the incident and any improvements planned to enhance future incident response.

By prioritizing communication in the incident response plan, organizations foster a collaborative environment where stakeholders are well-informed and actively engaged throughout the incident response process. This approach minimizes the impact of security incidents and reduces recovery time, ensuring a more resilient security posture.

### 3. Provide guidance on post-incident analysis

**Post-incident analysis** is a crucial step in the incident response lifecycle, enabling organizations to learn from incidents and enhance their security practices. It involves a comprehensive examination of the incident and the response, aiming to identify **lessons learned** and areas for improvement.

The post-incident analysis should commence promptly after the incident's resolution. The **incident response team** collects relevant data and diligently documents the incident and its response. This includes creating a detailed timeline of events, capturing the actions taken throughout the response, and preserving all communication related to the incident.

Once the initial data is gathered, the incident response team proceeds with a **root cause analysis** to determine the underlying cause of the incident. This involves reviewing **logs**, examining system configurations, and conducting vulnerability assessments. The root cause analysis uncovers any gaps or deficiencies in the incident response process, paving the way for recommendations and improvements.

Subsequently, the incident response team compiles a **post-incident report** that summarizes the incident, outlines the response actions taken, identifies the root cause, and provides recommendations for improvement. The report should be shared with **senior management**, the incident response team, and other relevant stakeholders to facilitate organizational learning.

A notable example of the importance of post-incident analysis is the **Equifax data breach** in 2017. Following the breach, Equifax conducted an in-depth analysis to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement. The analysis highlighted the need for enhanced **patch management** processes and improved communication channels during incidents.

To assist organizations in their post-incident analysis efforts, the **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** provides valuable guidance. It offers best practices for conducting a thorough analysis, including identifying the root cause, documenting the incident and response, and making recommendations for improvement. By following this guidance, organizations can continually enhance their incident response processes over time.

Conducting a comprehensive post-incident analysis is a critical step in building resilience and improving incident response capabilities. It enables organizations to learn from incidents, address weaknesses, and refine their security posture for future incidents.
