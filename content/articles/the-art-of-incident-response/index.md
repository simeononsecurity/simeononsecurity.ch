# The Art of Incident Response: Best Practices and Real-World Examples

Incident response is a critical component of an organization's cybersecurity posture. Effective incident response can help organizations minimize the impact of security incidents and reduce recovery time. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a framework for incident response, known as NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2. In this article, we will discuss the best practices for incident response according to NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 and suggest some improvements to the standard.

## Best Practices for Incident Response

NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 provides a framework for incident response that consists of four phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. The following are some best practices for each phase of the incident response process:

### Preparation Phase

- Develop an incident response plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, procedures for reporting and handling incidents, and communication channels with external parties.
- Train and educate the incident response team on the incident response plan, including the procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to incidents.
- Develop and maintain a list of critical assets and data, including their location, ownership, and sensitivity level.

### Detection and Analysis Phase

- Monitor the network and systems for suspicious activity and anomalies.
- Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and prevent attacks.
- Investigate suspicious activity to determine whether it is a legitimate incident.

### Containment Phase

- Isolate the affected systems and networks to prevent the incident from spreading.
- Collect and preserve evidence for analysis and potential legal proceedings.
- Identify and contain the root cause of the incident.

### Eradication and Recovery Phase

- Remove the malware or other malicious code from affected systems.
- Restore systems and data from backups.
- Patch vulnerabilities that were exploited in the incident.

## Improvements to NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2

While NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 provides a useful framework for incident response, there are some areas where it could be improved. The following are some suggested improvements:

### 1. Incorporate threat intelligence

Threat intelligence is the process of gathering and analyzing information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors. This information can be used to detect and respond to security incidents more effectively. Threat intelligence can be gathered from a variety of sources, including open-source intelligence, dark web forums, and commercial threat intelligence feeds.

By incorporating threat intelligence into their incident response processes, organizations can improve their ability to detect and respond to incidents. For example, if a threat actor is known to use a particular type of malware or exploit, threat intelligence can help organizations identify and block those threats before they can cause damage. Threat intelligence can also help organizations identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), which can be used to detect and respond to security incidents.

There are several ways that organizations can incorporate threat intelligence into their incident response processes. For example, organizations can subscribe to commercial threat intelligence feeds, which provide up-to-date information on known threats and vulnerabilities. Organizations can also leverage open-source intelligence to gather information about threat actors and their TTPs. Finally, organizations can use threat intelligence platforms to automate the process of gathering and analyzing threat intelligence.

For example, the cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 was a sophisticated and coordinated attack that used custom malware and targeted industrial control systems (ICS). The attack was attributed to a threat actor known as SandWorm, which was previously unknown. However, by analyzing the malware used in the attack, cybersecurity researchers were able to identify several IOCs that could be used to detect and respond to future attacks by SandWorm.

Incorporating threat intelligence into incident response processes can also help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture over time. By analyzing threat intelligence and identifying patterns and trends, organizations can identify areas of weakness in their security infrastructure and take steps to improve their defenses.

### 2. Emphasize the importance of communication

Effective communication is essential for successful incident response. Communication channels and procedures should be established in advance to ensure that stakeholders are informed and updated on the status of the incident. This includes internal communication within the incident response team and communication with external stakeholders, such as senior management, legal counsel, law enforcement, and customers.

The incident response plan should outline the communication channels and procedures that will be used during an incident. This includes identifying who will be responsible for communicating with internal and external stakeholders, how frequently updates will be provided, and what information will be shared. Clear and concise communication can help stakeholders make informed decisions and take appropriate actions during an incident.

For example, during a ransomware attack, communication is critical for coordinating the response and determining the best course of action. Internal communication within the incident response team is necessary to ensure that all members are aware of the latest information and that everyone is working toward a common goal. External communication with senior management is essential for keeping them informed of the incident and the impact on the organization. Communication with law enforcement is also important for reporting the incident and obtaining guidance on how to proceed.

In addition to outlining communication channels and procedures, the incident response plan should also address the importance of documenting all communication related to the incident. This includes maintaining logs of phone calls, emails, and other forms of communication, as well as documenting decisions made during the incident response process.

Effective communication is not only important during the incident response process but also during the post-incident analysis phase. After an incident has been resolved, stakeholders should be informed of the lessons learned and any changes that will be made to improve the incident response process in the future.

By emphasizing the importance of communication in the incident response plan, organizations can ensure that stakeholders are informed and involved in the incident response process, which can help to minimize the impact of security incidents and reduce recovery time.

### 3. Provide guidance on post-incident analysis

Post-incident analysis is an essential component of effective incident response. It involves a thorough examination of the incident and the response to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement. By conducting a post-incident analysis, organizations can identify gaps in their incident response processes and take steps to improve their overall security posture.

The post-incident analysis should begin as soon as possible after the incident has been resolved. The incident response team should gather data and document the incident and the response. This includes documenting the timeline of the incident, the actions taken during the response, and any communication related to the incident.

After the initial data has been collected, the incident response team should conduct a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the incident. This may involve reviewing logs, examining system configurations, and conducting vulnerability assessments. The root cause analysis should identify any gaps in the incident response process and make recommendations for improvement.

Once the root cause analysis has been completed, the incident response team should develop a post-incident report that summarizes the incident and the response, identifies the root cause, and makes recommendations for improvement. The post-incident report should be shared with senior management, the incident response team, and other stakeholders.

For example, after the Equifax data breach in 2017, the company conducted a post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement. The analysis identified several areas where the incident response process could be improved, including the need for better patch management processes and improved communication channels during an incident.

By providing more guidance on post-incident analysis, NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 can help organizations improve their incident response processes over time. The guidance should include best practices for conducting a post-incident analysis, such as identifying the root cause of the incident, documenting the incident and the response, and making recommendations for improvement. The guidance should also emphasize the importance of using the post-incident analysis to continuously improve the incident response process.

## Real-World Examples of Incident Response

### 1. Equifax Data Breach

In 2017, Equifax suffered a massive data breach that affected over 143 million customers. The incident was caused by a vulnerability in the company's IT systems. Equifax's incident response plan was inadequate, and the company did not detect the breach for several months. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in an open-source software package used by Equifax.

Once the breach was detected, Equifax took steps to contain and mitigate the incident. The company disabled the affected systems and hired a third-party forensic investigation firm to conduct an investigation. The investigation found that the breach was caused by a failure to patch a known vulnerability in the open-source software package.

Equifax took steps to remediate and recover from the incident by implementing new security controls, offering free credit monitoring to affected customers, and paying out millions of dollars in settlements and fines.

### 2. NotPetya Ransomware Attack

In 2017, the NotPetya ransomware attack affected companies around the world, causing billions of dollars in damages. The attack was spread through a software update for a popular accounting software package. The attack used a combination of known vulnerabilities and custom malware to propagate through networks and encrypt data.

Organizations that had effective incident response plans were able to quickly identify and contain the attack. For example, shipping giant Maersk was able to isolate infected systems and restore operations within a few days. However, many organizations were unprepared and suffered significant damage as a result of the attack.

### 3. SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack
In 2020, a supply chain attack on SolarWinds, a software vendor, affected multiple government agencies and private organizations. The attack was carried out by a state-sponsored group that inserted malware into a software update for SolarWinds' Orion product.

Organizations that had effective incident response plans were able to quickly identify and contain the attack. For example, the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive instructing federal agencies to disconnect affected SolarWinds Orion products. Private organizations also took steps to identify and remove affected systems.

### 4. Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack
In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel pipeline operator in the United States, suffered a ransomware attack that caused a temporary shutdown of its pipeline. The attack was carried out by a cybercriminal group known as DarkSide.

Colonial Pipeline's incident response plan allowed the company to quickly identify and contain the attack. The company shut down its pipeline as a precaution and hired a third-party forensic investigation firm to conduct an investigation. The company also communicated with federal agencies and other stakeholders to coordinate the response.

### 5. Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerability
In early 2021, multiple zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered in Microsoft Exchange Server, a popular email and collaboration platform. The vulnerabilities allowed attackers to access and steal sensitive data from affected systems.

Organizations that had effective incident response plans were able to quickly identify and patch the vulnerabilities. Microsoft issued patches for the vulnerabilities, and organizations were advised to apply the patches immediately. However, many organizations were slow to patch their systems, leaving them vulnerable to attack.

## Conclusion
Real-world examples of incident response demonstrate the importance of effective incident response planning and preparation. By following best practices and continuously improving incident response processes, organizations can be better prepared to respond to security incidents and protect their assets and data. The incidents discussed in this article, including the Equifax data breach, NotPetya ransomware attack, SolarWinds supply chain attack, Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, and Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability, highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and the importance of maintaining a proactive and effective incident response strategy.
