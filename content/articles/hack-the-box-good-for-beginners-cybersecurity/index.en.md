## The Challenge for Beginners

### 1. **Advanced Difficulty Level**

HTB is known for its challenging scenarios, which can be overwhelming for beginners. The platform primarily targets experienced individuals who already possess a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts. Newcomers may find themselves struggling to keep up with the difficulty level, hindering their learning experience.

### 2. **Limited Guided Learning**

Unlike other platforms that offer structured courses and tutorials, HTB lacks sufficient guided learning resources for beginners. The absence of step-by-step instructions or tutorials means that beginners might feel lost or unsure of how to proceed, resulting in frustration and discouragement.

### 3. **Time-Intensive**

HTB challenges demand a significant time commitment. For beginners, who may not have as much spare time, this might not be feasible. Balancing HTB challenges with other learning commitments or responsibilities could become a challenge in itself.
