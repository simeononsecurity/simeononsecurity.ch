For example, the [Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-2960-series-switches/data_sheet_c78-584733.html) switches are commonly used in Home Lab setups.

- **Virtualization software**, such as **VMware** or **VirtualBox**, to create virtual machines (VMs) on your main host. These software tools allow you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously. For example, VMware provides the popular [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) and [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) for virtualization.

- **Operating systems**, such as **Windows** or **Linux**, to install on your virtual machines. These operating systems provide the foundation for running various applications and services in your Home Lab. For example, you can download the latest version of [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) for free.

- **Storage**, such as **hard drives** or **solid-state drives (SSDs)**, to store your virtual machine files and data. The storage capacity you need will depend on the size and number of virtual machines you plan to run. For example, the [Samsung 860 EVO](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-860-evo-sata-3-2-5-inch-1tb-mz-76e1t0b-am/) is a popular SSD choice for Home Lab enthusiasts.

Remember, these are just some examples of common components. The specific hardware and software you choose will depend on your budget, requirements, and personal preferences. Building a Home Lab is a flexible process that allows you to customize your setup according to your needs.
