**HackTheBox vs TryHackMe: Which is the Best for Junior Penetration Testing?**

Before we dive into the details, let's first define what we mean by "junior" penetration testing. Typically, **a junior penetration tester is someone who is just starting out in the field and has limited experience with cybersecurity.**

### What is HackTheBox?

**HackTheBox is an online platform that provides challenges and virtual machines to help users learn cybersecurity skills.** The challenges range from simple to extremely difficult, and cover a wide range of topics such as web application security, network security, cryptography, and more. HackTheBox has a large and active community of users, and offers both free and paid subscription options.

### What is TryHackMe?

**TryHackMe is another online platform that provides challenges and virtual machines to help users learn cybersecurity skills.** Unlike HackTheBox, TryHackMe is more focused on providing a guided learning experience for beginners. The challenges are structured in a way that helps users build their skills and knowledge gradually. TryHackMe also has a large community of users, and offers both free and paid subscription options.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Both

#### Strengths of HackTheBox

HackTheBox is best suited for users who are already comfortable with basic cybersecurity concepts and want to challenge themselves with more advanced topics. **The challenges are designed to be extremely difficult, and will require users to think creatively and outside of the box.** Additionally, HackTheBox has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources available to help users when they get stuck.

#### Weaknesses of HackTheBox

One of the main weaknesses of HackTheBox is that **it can be very difficult for beginners.** The challenges are designed to be challenging, and can be frustrating for users who are not yet comfortable with basic cybersecurity concepts. Additionally, the platform does not provide much guidance or structure, which can be overwhelming for some users.

#### Strengths of TryHackMe

TryHackMe is best suited for users who are just starting out with cybersecurity and want a more structured learning experience. **The challenges are designed to build on each other, which means users can gradually build their skills and knowledge.** Additionally, TryHackMe provides a lot of guidance and support, which can be very helpful for beginners.

#### Weaknesses of TryHackMe

One of the main weaknesses of TryHackMe is that the challenges can be too easy for more advanced users. If you're already comfortable with basic cybersecurity concepts, you may find the challenges to be too simple and not challenging enough. Additionally, **TryHackMe's community is not as large as HackTheBox's, which means there may be fewer resources available to help when you get stuck.**

### Comparison

Both HackTheBox and TryHackMe are excellent platforms for learning cybersecurity skills, but they are designed for different types of users. HackTheBox is best suited for users who are already comfortable with basic cybersecurity concepts and want to challenge themselves with more advanced topics. TryHackMe, on the other hand, is best suited for users who are just starting out with cybersecurity and want a more structured learning experience.

### Contrast

The main difference between HackTheBox and TryHackMe is the level of difficulty. **HackTheBox challenges are designed to be extremely difficult, while TryHackMe challenges are designed to be more approachable for beginners.** Additionally, HackTheBox does not provide much guidance or structure, which can be overwhelming for some users. TryHackMe, on the other hand, provides a lot of guidance and support, which can be very helpful for beginners.

### Criteria

To evaluate which platform is best for learning junior penetration testing, we'll consider the following criteria:

- **Difficulty**: How challenging are the challenges?
- **Structure**: How structured is the learning experience?
- **Support**: How much guidance and support is provided?
- **Real-world applicability**: How applicable are the skills learned to real-world cybersecurity challenges?

### Evaluation

Based on these criteria, we believe that TryHackMe is the best platform for learning junior penetration testing. **The challenges are designed to be approachable for beginners, and the learning experience is well-structured with a lot of guidance and support.** While the challenges may be easier than those on HackTheBox, they are still designed to be applicable to real-world cybersecurity scenarios, which means that users will develop skills that are directly applicable to the industry.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've compared HackTheBox and TryHackMe and evaluated which one is best for learning junior penetration testing. While both platforms are excellent for learning cybersecurity skills, we believe that TryHackMe is the best platform for beginners who are just starting out in the field. **With its structured learning experience and abundant guidance and support, TryHackMe provides an excellent starting point for anyone looking to get into penetration testing.** However, for more advanced users who are already comfortable with basic cybersecurity concepts, HackTheBox may be the better option, as its challenges are designed to be more difficult and closer to real-world scenarios.

No matter which platform you choose, the most important thing is to keep learning and practicing. **The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and there is always something new to learn. By using platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe, you can develop the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in this exciting and challenging field.**
