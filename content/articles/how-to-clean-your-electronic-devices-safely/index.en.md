When using isopropyl alcohol to clean your electronic devices, it is important to follow these guidelines:

1.  **Dilute the alcohol** with water or use a pre-moistened alcohol wipe to avoid using it in its pure form, which can be too harsh for some surfaces.
2.  **Apply the alcohol** to a microfiber cloth or cotton swab, rather than directly spraying it onto the device, to prevent liquid from seeping into sensitive areas.
3.  **Gently wipe** the device's surfaces in a circular motion, applying light pressure to remove dirt and smudges.

Remember to always check the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning recommendations specific to your device.

### Compressed Air Duster

A compressed air duster is an essential tool for cleaning electronic devices. It is especially useful for removing dust and debris from hard-to-reach areas. **Compressed air** is a powerful tool that can effectively blow away dust particles without causing any damage to the delicate components of your devices. Here are some key points to keep in mind when using a compressed air duster:

*   Hold the can upright and use short bursts of air to clean the device.
*   Keep a distance of at least a few inches between the nozzle of the duster and the device to avoid any potential damage.
*   Use the duster in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhaling any harmful chemicals.

> Tip: Before using the compressed air duster, it's a good idea to power off your device and unplug it from any power source. This will ensure your safety and prevent any potential damage to the device.

Remember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions when using a compressed air duster to clean your electronic devices.
