# The role of container orchestration in modern DevOps environments

DevOps and containerization are among the top buzzwords in the world of IT. In particular, **container orchestration** is one of the essential components of modern-day DevOps. It is a process that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containerized applications.

In this article, we'll look at the significance of container orchestration in modern-day DevOps environments and discuss some popular container orchestration tools.

## Why do we need container orchestration?

**Containers** are an essential part of DevOps for several reasons. They allow you to package your application and its dependencies into a single unit. This makes it easy to move these containers across different environments, from development to production. Containers provide consistency, portability, and standardization across all stages of the application lifecycle. 

However, managing containers manually can be challenging as you have to keep track of several containers running on multiple hosts or nodes. Container orchestration helps simplify this process by automating several tasks involved in managing containers.

## Benefits of container orchestration
There are several benefits to using container orchestration in modern-day DevOps environments:

- **Scalability**: Container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes can help scale containers horizontally by automatically deploying new instances when traffic increases.

- **High-availability**: Orchestrators also handle failures by automatically restarting failed containers or rescheduling them to run on healthy nodes.

- **Load balancing**: They can also distribute traffic evenly across containers running on different nodes, avoiding any single point of failure.

- **Security**: Container orchestrators come with built-in security features such as network segmentation, secret management, and access controls that help secure your applications.

- **Automated app deployments**: Container orchestrators can automate the deployment process to ensure consistency and speed up rollouts.

## Popular container orchestration tools

There are several container orchestration tools in the market, but we'll look at three of the most popular ones: **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm,** and **Apache Mesos**.

### Kubernetes
**Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration tool that is widely used in the industry. It was initially developed by Google but is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a highly scalable and fault-tolerant platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

One of the primary advantages of Kubernetes is its strong community support. This means that you can find several resources, documentation, and support forums online. Moreover, there are several third-party tools such as Helm that can simplify your Kubernetes deployment process.

### Docker Swarm
**Docker Swarm** is a native orchestration tool built into the Docker Engine. It provides a simple way to manage and deploy containers at scale. With Docker Swarm, you can create a highly-available cluster of nodes for running your applications.

One of the advantages of Docker Swarm is its ease of use. If you're already using Docker to build and run your containers, adding Docker Swarm to your workflow will be straightforward. Unlike Kubernetes, which requires a certain level of expertise to set up and manage, Docker Swarm has a shallow learning curve.

### Apache Mesos
**Apache Mesos** is another open-source container orchestration tool. It abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other computing resources from machines (physical or virtual) into a single pool of resources. Mesos then allocates these resources to applications in a way that maximizes utilization while maintaining predictability and fault tolerance.

Some large companies such as Uber have successfully used Mesos to manage their microservices architecture.

## Government regulations on containerization

Organizations need to ensure their containerization practices comply with government regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

HIPAA requires that health providers ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Organizations must ensure that their container platforms are compliant with HIPAA.

SOX is an act passed by the United States Congress in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent accounting activities. If your organization is subject to SOX, you must ensure that your container platform meets the SOX compliance requirements.

GDPR is a regulation passed by the European Union with a focus on protecting the privacy of EU citizens. Organizations must ensure that their container platform complies with GDPR if they process personal data of EU citizens.

## Final Thoughts

Container orchestration has become an essential component of modern-day DevOps. It allows organizations to manage, deploy, and scale containers efficiently. Kubernetes is currently the most popular orchestration tool in the industry, but Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos can also be suitable options depending on your organization's requirements. Ensure your container platform is compliant with government regulations relevant to your organization.
