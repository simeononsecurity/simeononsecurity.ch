**Protect Yourself from Unauthorized Offers with Credit Opt-Out**

Identity theft is a growing concern in today's world, and pre-approved credit and insurance offers can be a prime target for thieves. These offers contain sensitive information like your name, address, and credit score, making them valuable to those looking to steal your identity.

**Fortunately**, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives consumers the right to opt-out of these offers. This means you can **prevent** consumer credit reporting companies from including your name on lists used by creditors or insurers to make firm offers of credit or insurance. By opting-out, you will no longer receive pre-approved credit and insurance offers in the mail, making it more difficult for identity thieves to steal your information.
