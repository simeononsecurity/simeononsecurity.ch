# Protect Yourself from Unauthorized Offers with Credit Opt-Out

Identity theft is a growing concern in today's world, and pre-approved credit and insurance offers can be a prime target for thieves. These offers contain sensitive information like your name, address, and credit score, making them valuable to those looking to steal your identity.

Fortunately, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives consumers the right to opt-out of these offers. This means you can prevent consumer credit reporting companies from including your name on lists used by creditors or insurers to make firm offers of credit or insurance. By opting-out, you will no longer receive pre-approved credit and insurance offers in the mail, making it more difficult for identity thieves to steal your information.

Opting-out is simple and can be done through the website [optoutprescreen.com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/). You can request to opt-out for five years through this website, or you can opt-out permanently by printing a form and sending it through postal mail.

In conclusion, opting-out of pre-approved credit and insurance offers is an important step in protecting yourself from identity theft. By doing so, you can prevent sensitive information from being included in lists used by creditors and insurers, making it more difficult for identity thieves to steal your information. Take advantage of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and opt-out today.
