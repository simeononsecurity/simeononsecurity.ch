### Coverage Area

One of the primary advantages of a Wi-Fi mesh system is its ability to provide **consistent coverage throughout your home**.

Mesh systems with **dedicated backhaul channels** also offer improved performance by ensuring optimal communication between the main router and satellite nodes. Assess the maximum data transfer speeds and latency of each system to ensure it meets your bandwidth requirements.

### Ease of Setup and Use

Setting up a Wi-Fi mesh system should be a hassle-free experience. The best mesh systems come with **user-friendly setup procedures** and intuitive mobile apps that guide you through the installation process.

Features such as **WPA3 encryption**, **guest network support**, **firewall protection**, and **malware filtering** can help safeguard your network from potential threats. Some mesh systems even offer **built-in antivirus and parental control functionalities** for added peace of mind.

### Scalability and Expandability

As your connectivity needs grow, it's essential to choose a Wi-Fi mesh system that is **scalable and expandable**.
