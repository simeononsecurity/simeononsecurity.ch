## Who Designates Whether Information is Classified and its Classification Level

Information classification plays a critical role in safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring national security. **Designating whether information is classified and determining its classification level** involves a structured process governed by established regulations and guidelines. In this article, we will explore the key entities and procedures involved in information classification.

### Introduction

**Information classification** is the process of categorizing data based on its level of sensitivity, the potential harm that could result from its unauthorized disclosure, and the level of protection required. By assigning a classification level, organizations can control access to information and implement appropriate security measures. But who has the authority to designate whether information is classified and determine its classification level? Let's find out.

### Classification Authority

The **classification authority** is responsible for designating whether information is classified and establishing its classification level. This authority may vary depending on the context and type of information. In the United States, the **Original Classification Authority (OCA)** is often responsible for classifying national security information.

The OCA is an individual authorized by an executive order or government directive to classify information in the interest of national security. This authority is granted based on their role, expertise, and the need to know. For example, a high-ranking military official may be designated as the OCA for classifying sensitive military intelligence.

As the OCA, they have the crucial task of applying **classification markings** to documents or electronic files to indicate the level of protection required. These markings can include labels such as **"Top Secret," "Secret,"** or **"Confidential"**. The classification authority ensures that the information is appropriately protected and only accessible to authorized individuals with the necessary security clearance and need-to-know.

For example, the OCA may classify a detailed military operation plan as **"Top Secret"** to prevent its disclosure, as its unauthorized exposure could have severe consequences for national security. The classification authority's role is vital in safeguarding sensitive information and preventing potential threats to the country.

To learn more about the classification authority and its responsibilities, you can refer to the official documentation such as the **Executive Order 13526** issued by the U.S. government, which outlines the principles and guidelines for classifying national security information.

### Classification Levels

Information classification is typically categorized into several levels, each indicating the degree of sensitivity and protection required. The specific classification levels may vary depending on the country and organization. Let's explore some commonly used classification levels:

1. **Top Secret**: This is the highest level of classification, used for information that, if disclosed, could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security or endanger ongoing operations.
2. **Secret**: This level is used for information that, if revealed, could cause serious damage to national security or compromise ongoing operations.
3. **Confidential**: Confidential information, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security or harm to government interests.
4. **Restricted**: This classification level is used for information that requires protection due to privacy, proprietary, or other sensitivities but does not fall into higher classification levels.

These classification levels are hierarchical, with each subsequent level indicating a lower degree of sensitivity and protection requirements.

### Classification Levels

Information classification involves categorizing data into different **classification levels** based on their sensitivity and required protection. While the specific classification levels may vary across countries and organizations, here are some commonly used examples:

1. **Top Secret**: This is the highest level of classification and is assigned to information that, if disclosed, could result in **exceptionally grave damage** to national security or ongoing operations. Examples of top-secret information include **nuclear weapon designs**, **intelligence sources**, and **highly sensitive military plans**.

2. **Secret**: The secret classification level is used for information that, if revealed, could cause **serious damage** to national security or compromise ongoing operations. Examples of secret information include **intelligence reports**, **cryptographic algorithms**, and **designs of advanced weapon systems**.

3. **Confidential**: Information classified as confidential, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to cause **damage** to national security or harm to government interests. Examples of confidential information include **law enforcement tactics**, **sensitive diplomatic cables**, and **financial data related to government operations**.

4. **Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU)**: SBU information refers to sensitive information that does not meet the criteria for classification but still requires protection from unauthorized disclosure. It encompasses information such as **personally identifiable information (PII)**, **proprietary business data**, or **law enforcement techniques**.

5. **For Official Use Only (FOUO)**: FOUO is a designation used for information that, while unclassified, requires protection and is intended for official use only. It includes information that, if released, could cause **harm** to individuals, government entities, or commercial interests. Examples of FOUO information include **pre-decisional draft documents**, **procurement-sensitive data**, and **sensitive research findings**.

6. **Unclassified**: Unclassified information is not classified and does not require specific protection measures due to its sensitivity. However, it is still essential to handle unclassified information with care and discretion to protect privacy and prevent unauthorized disclosure.

These classification levels form a hierarchy, where each subsequent level indicates a **lower degree of sensitivity** and corresponding protection requirements. It is crucial for organizations and individuals to understand and adhere to the proper handling and protection measures associated with each classification level to maintain the integrity and security of the information.

To gain further insights into the classification levels and their associated guidelines, you can refer to the **government regulations** and **classification manuals** provided by the respective authorities, such as the **National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)** or similar documents relevant to your country or organization.

### Government Regulations

Information classification is subject to various **government regulations and guidelines** to ensure consistency and adherence to security practices. These regulations play a crucial role in establishing a framework for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying sensitive information. Here are some notable regulations in this context:

- **Executive Order 13526**: This **executive order**, issued by the President of the United States, establishes the framework for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying **national security information**. It provides guidelines for classification authorities and outlines the criteria for determining the levels of classification.

- **National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)**: The **NISPOM** provides comprehensive guidance for protecting **classified information** held by contractors working with the U.S. government. It covers various aspects such as personnel security, physical security, and information security measures to ensure the proper handling and protection of classified data.

- **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)**: ITAR is a set of **regulations** that control the export and temporary import of defense articles and services, including **classified information**, to protect national security. It imposes stringent requirements on individuals and organizations involved in the defense industry to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive information to foreign entities.

By complying with these regulations, organizations and individuals involved in handling classified information can ensure that proper procedures are followed, and the necessary security measures are in place to safeguard sensitive data. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in severe consequences, including legal penalties and damage to national security.

To learn more about these regulations and their specific requirements, you can refer to the official documentation and resources provided by the respective authorities. For example, you can access the **Executive Order 13526** on the [Official Gazette of the United States](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information) website, explore the **NISPOM** on the [Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA)](https://www.dcsa.mil/) website, and find detailed information about **ITAR** on the [U.S. Department of State](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_itar_landing) website.
