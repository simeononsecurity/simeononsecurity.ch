**What to do when you've been doxxed**

**Doxxing**, the act of publicly **revealing someone's private or personal information without their consent**, has become a growing concern in the digital age. With the increasing amount of personal information available online, it has become easier for malicious individuals to obtain and expose sensitive details about individuals. If you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of being doxxed, it's important to take immediate action to protect yourself and mitigate the potential damage. This article will guide you through the steps you should take when you've been doxxed.

## Introduction

**Doxxing** can have severe consequences, ranging from **invasion of privacy to harassment, stalking, and identity theft**. It's crucial to respond promptly and effectively to minimize the impact on your personal and professional life. Here are the steps you should follow when dealing with a doxxing incident.

______

## The Threats of Having Your Information Leaked Online

When your personal information is **leaked online** through doxxing, it exposes you to various threats and risks that can have serious consequences. Here are some of the key threats you may face:

### 1. Swatting

**Swatting** is a dangerous and potentially life-threatening hoax in which someone makes a false emergency call, typically to law enforcement, with the intent of having a heavily armed police response sent to the victim's location. This malicious act can result in physical harm, property damage, and extreme emotional distress.

### 2. Identity Theft

One of the most significant risks of having your information leaked is **identity theft**. Cybercriminals can use your personal details, such as your name, address, Social Security number, or financial information, to commit fraud, open fraudulent accounts, or make unauthorized purchases. Identity theft can lead to significant financial losses and damage to your credit score.

### 3. Hacking and Cyberattacks

When your personal information is exposed, it becomes easier for malicious individuals to **hack** into your accounts or devices. They can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media, or financial accounts, compromising your digital life. Cyberattacks can also lead to the loss of sensitive data, including confidential work documents or personal photographs.

### 4. Harassment and Stalking

Doxxing opens the door for **harassment** and **stalking**. Attackers can use the leaked information to harass you through various means, such as sending threatening messages, making harassing phone calls, or even showing up at your doorstep. This invasion of privacy can cause immense fear, stress, and disruption in your daily life.

### 5. Robbery and Physical Harm

In some cases, doxxing can expose your physical location or other sensitive details, making you vulnerable to **robbery** or **physical harm**. Malicious individuals can use the leaked information to plan and execute criminal activities, posing a direct threat to your safety and well-being.

### 6. Reputation Damage

Having your personal information leaked can tarnish your **reputation** both personally and professionally. False information or misleading claims may be associated with your name, leading to misunderstandings or damaging your relationships. Rebuilding your reputation can be a lengthy and challenging process.

It's important to recognize these threats and take immediate action to protect yourself when you've been doxxed. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can minimize the impact of doxxing and mitigate the risks associated with the exposure of your personal information.

______

## What to do if you've been Doxxed

### 1. Stay calm and assess the situation

The first and **most important** step is to **remain calm** and composed. It's natural to feel **anger, fear, or anxiety** when your personal information is exposed without your consent, but panicking won't help. Take a moment to **gather your thoughts** and evaluate the extent of the doxxing. 

For example, if your home address has been revealed, consider the potential risks associated with that information. Are you at risk of physical harm or harassment? Understanding the specific risks will help you determine the appropriate actions to take.

Assess what **information** has been **leaked** and how it may potentially **harm** you. This may include your full name, address, phone number, email address, or other sensitive details. The more comprehensive the doxxing, the higher the potential risk. 

Remember, the goal is to respond in a **calm and calculated** manner, ensuring your actions are effective in mitigating the impact of the doxxing incident.

### 2. Document the doxxing evidence

It's crucial to **collect evidence** of the doxxing incident for future reference. Take **screenshots** or save copies of any posts, messages, or websites that contain your exposed information. This evidence will be valuable if you decide to **report the incident** to law enforcement authorities or take legal action against the doxxer.

For example, if someone has shared your personal information on a social media platform, take a screenshot of the post showing the details that have been exposed. If you received threatening messages or emails, save copies of those as well. These pieces of evidence will help establish the nature and extent of the doxxing, making it easier for authorities to investigate and potentially hold the responsible party accountable.

Remember to **preserve the original evidence** and make backups of the files. This ensures that the information remains intact and admissible, should you need to provide it to law enforcement or legal professionals.

If you're unsure how to capture screenshots on your device, refer to the **documentation** provided by the manufacturer or search online for specific instructions based on your device and operating system. Otherwise, please see the following [article](https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device).

### 3. Remove personal information from public platforms

Take **immediate action** to **remove your personal information** from public platforms, such as **social media**, **websites**, or **online directories**. Disable or restrict access to personal accounts, and consider **temporarily deactivating** your profiles until the situation is resolved. 

For example, if your personal information is publicly visible on a social media platform, navigate to your account settings and **restrict the visibility** of your personal details, such as your address, phone number, or email address. Consider setting your profile to **private** to limit access to trusted individuals only.

Perform a search on popular search engines using your **name** and other relevant information to **identify websites** or online directories that display your personal information without your consent. Contact the **website administrators** and request the **removal** of the unauthorized personal information. Provide them with the necessary details and evidence to support your request.

Additionally, if you have any **professional profiles** on platforms like LinkedIn, review the information displayed and ensure that you've **restricted access** to sensitive details that could be used for malicious purposes.

By taking these steps, you reduce the accessibility of your personal information and make it more challenging for individuals to exploit it. Remember to regularly monitor your online presence to ensure that your information remains secure and protected.

### 7. Monitor your online presence

After a doxxing incident, it's crucial to be **vigilant** about monitoring your online presence.

Set up [**Google Alerts**](https://www.google.com/alerts) to receive notifications whenever your name appears online.
