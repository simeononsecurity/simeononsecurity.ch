# The Importance of Compliance and Professionalism in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of modern business operations and it is essential that organizations have the right systems and protocols in place to protect their networks, systems, and sensitive information. In today's world, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and it is imperative that companies take the necessary steps to ensure that their defenses are up to the challenge. However, implementing a cybersecurity program is more than just purchasing the latest technology and software. Organizations must also maintain a high level of professionalism and ensure compliance with industry standards, regulations, and best practices.

If an organization is not fully committed to cybersecurity, it is likely that other issues are at play. Companies that do not prioritize cybersecurity will often struggle to maintain their defenses and keep up with the changing threat landscape. This can lead to a variety of problems, including data breaches, theft of intellectual property, or loss of sensitive information. It is therefore essential that organizations take a proactive approach to cybersecurity and work to create a culture of security that is focused on protecting their systems and data.

In many organizations, the role of cybersecurity is often relegated to a low priority. This can occur when companies do not fully understand the importance of cybersecurity or when they are not fully committed to implementing the necessary measures to ensure their systems are secure. Unfortunately, this can result in a lack of resources, insufficient training, and a lack of commitment to security, which can lead to a higher risk of cyber attacks. In order to overcome these challenges, companies must work to create a culture of security and prioritize cybersecurity in their operations.

One challenge in maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture is the lack of experience and knowledge among information security officers (ISSOs) and information security management systems (ISSMs). Without proper training and experience, these individuals are not equipped to effectively manage and maintain the organization's cybersecurity program. This can lead to a failure to identify and address security threats, leaving the organization vulnerable to attack. Organizations must ensure that their ISSOs and ISSMs have the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to effectively manage the security of their systems.

Another challenge in maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture is the pressure to achieve 100% success on compliance audits. Unfortunately, this expectation is not realistic, as there is always room for improvement in any cybersecurity program. Companies must recognize that a small number of findings on an audit does not necessarily indicate a failure, but rather an opportunity for improvement. Organizations must work to understand the regulations, standards, and best practices that apply to their operations, and work to ensure they are compliant with these guidelines. This can involve reading the NIST 800 series and other relevant documentation, and memorizing important passages to ensure a high level of understanding.

In many organizations, cybersecurity can become a political game, with individuals and teams vying for power and control. This can result in a lack of collaboration and communication, making it more difficult to effectively manage and maintain the organization's cybersecurity posture. To overcome this challenge, companies must work to create an environment of trust, honesty, and collaboration, where everyone works together to ensure the security of the organization's systems and data. This can involve the use of tools such as paper trail to ensure transparency and accountability, and encourage individuals to be diligent and proactive in their efforts to maintain a high level of security.

In conclusion, organizations must take a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that they have the right systems, protocols, and personnel in place to effectively manage their defenses. This requires a commitment to cybersecurity, a focus on professionalism and compliance, and a culture of security that is focused on protecting systems and data. By working together and prioritizing cybersecurity, organizations can ensure that their systems and data are protected from the threat of cyber attacks.
