**How to Use PowerCLI to STIG VMware**

PowerCLI is a powerful automation and scripting tool that allows users to manage and configure VMware environments using PowerShell. In this article, we will explore how to leverage PowerCLI to implement the VMware STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) for securing VMware ESXi and virtual machines.

## Introduction

The **VMware STIG** provides guidelines and recommendations for securely configuring and managing VMware infrastructure. By following the STIG, organizations can enhance the security posture of their VMware deployments and ensure compliance with relevant government regulations, such as the **Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIG**.

## What is PowerCLI?

**PowerCLI** is a command-line interface and scripting tool for managing VMware environments. It is built on top of PowerShell and provides a vast set of cmdlets specifically designed for VMware administration. With PowerCLI, administrators can automate repetitive tasks, perform configuration changes, and gather information from VMware infrastructure.

### Installation and Requirements

Before getting started with PowerCLI and VMware STIG, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [**PowerCLI 11.3**](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VMware.PowerCLI/11.3.0.13990089): Install PowerCLI using the PowerShell Gallery with the command `Install-Module VMware.PowerCLI -force`.
- [**Powershell 5 or newer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/download-and-install-windows-powershell-5-1): Ensure you have PowerShell version 5 or newer installed.
- [**ESXi 6.7 U2+**](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=ESXI670&productId=742): Make sure you are using ESXi version 6.7 U2 or above.

## Automating VMware VCSA STIG

The VMware ESXi STIG provides guidelines for securing ESXi hosts. By automating the implementation of STIG controls, administrators can streamline the process and ensure consistent configuration across multiple hosts.

### Considerations

Before proceeding with the automation, it is important to consider the following points:

- **Ensure that no virtual machine or guest on the ESXi host or cluster requires CD, USB, or Floppy Disk functionality.**
- **All ESXi hosts and guests tied to vCenter need to be STIG'ed.**
- **Troubleshooting skills are necessary to address any issues that may arise during the process.**

### Script: VMware VCSA STIG Automation

The following PowerCLI script can be used to automate the implementation of selected STIG controls for VCSAs:

```powershell
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore -Confirm:$false
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false -Confirm:$false
$vcenters = 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2

#Connect to each vcenter server
ForEach ($vc in $vcenters) {
    Connect-VIServer -Server $vc
}

```

Let's break down the script and understand its functionalities:

- **The script starts by configuring the PowerCLI environment, disabling certificate validation, and opting out of the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).**
- **Next, it connects to the vCenter servers specified in the `$vcenters` variable.**
- **Each STIG control is then addressed individually using PowerCLI cmdlets. For example, the script sets the `config.log.level` to "info" for the specified vCenter servers.**
- **The script continues to address other STIG controls, such as `config.vpxd.hostPasswordLength`, `VirtualCenter.VimPasswordExpirationInDays`, and more.**
- **Finally, the script performs a series of checks and configurations related to security policies and settings.**
- **Please note that this script serves as an example and should be customized to meet the specific requirements of your environment. It demonstrates the capabilities of PowerCLI in automating STIG implementation.**

## Automating VMware VM STIG
In addition to securing ESXi hosts, it is essential to apply STIG controls to virtual machines (VMs) running on the VMware infrastructure. PowerCLI can help automate the process of configuring VMs according to STIG guidelines.

## Script: VMWare VM STIG Automation
The following PowerCLI script demonstrates how to automate the implementation of selected STIG controls for VMs:

```powershell
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore -Confirm:$false
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false -Confirm:$false
Connect-VIServer -Server 127.0.0.1
$cluster = Get-Cluster -Name "Cluster"
$folder = Get-Folder -Name "Folder"

        "isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable"    = $true

        "isolation.tools.hgfsServerSet.disable" = $true
        "RemoteDisplay.maxConnections"          = "1"
        "RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled"             = $false

    }
    vmAdvSettingsRemove = ("sched.mem.pshare.salt")
    vmotionEncryption   = "opportunistic" #disabled, required, opportunistic
}

ForEach ($vm in (Get-VM -Location $cluster | Where-Object { (Get-VM -Location $folder) -contains $_ } )) {
    Write-Output "...Remediating advanced settings on $vm on $vcenter"
    ForEach ($setting in ($vmconfig.vmAdvSettings.GetEnumerator() | Sort-Object Name)) {
        #Pulling values for each setting specified
        $settingname = $setting.name
        $settingvalue = $setting.value
        If ($asetting = $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name $settingname) {
            If ($asetting.value -eq $settingvalue) {
                Write-Output "...Setting $settingname is already configured correctly to $settingvalue on $vm"
            }
            else {
                Write-Output "...Setting $settingname was incorrectly set to $($asetting.value) on $vm setting to $settingvalue"
                $asetting | Set-AdvancedSetting -Value $settingvalue -Confirm:$false
            }
        }
        else {
            Write-Output "...Setting $settingname does not exist on $vm creating setting..."
            $vm | New-AdvancedSetting -Name $settingname -Value $settingvalue -Confirm:$false
        }
        Write-Output "...Removing advanced settings if necessary on $vm on $vcenter"
        ForEach ($setting in ($vmconfig.vmAdvSettingsRemove | Sort-Object Name)) {
            #Checking to see if current setting exists
            If ($asetting = $vm | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name $setting) {
                Write-Output "...Setting $setting exists on $vm...removing setting"
                $asetting | Remove-AdvancedSetting -Confirm:$false
            }
            else {
                Write-Output "...Setting $setting does not exist on $vm"
            }
        }   
        If ($vm.extensiondata.Config.MigrateEncryption -eq $vmconfig.vmotionEncryption) {
            Write-Output "...vMotion encryption set correctly on $vm to $($vmconfig.vmotionEncryption)"
        }
        else {
            $vmv = $vm | get-view
            $config = new-object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec
            $config.MigrateEncryption = New-object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpecEncryptedVMotionModes
            $config.MigrateEncryption = "$($vmconfig.vmotionEncryption)"
            $vmv.ReconfigVM($config)
        }
    }
}
```

Let's understand the script and its functionality:

- **Similar to the VMWare VCSA STIG script, the PowerCLI environment is configured at the beginning.**
- **The script connects to the vCenter and selects the target cluster and folder where the VMs reside.**
- **The `$vmconfig` variable contains the VM STIG settings that will be applied. It includes advanced VM settings, such as disabling copy and paste, limiting remote display connections, and more.**
- **The script loops through each VM in the specified cluster and folder, applying the STIG settings to the VMs.**
- **Additionally, the script addresses vMotion encryption settings for the VMs.**

Again, this script is provided as an example, and you should modify it according to your specific environment and STIG requirements.

## Conclusion
**Implementing the VMware STIG is crucial for enhancing the security of VMware infrastructure and achieving compliance with relevant regulations. PowerCLI enables automation and simplifies the process of applying STIG controls to both ESXi hosts and VMs.**

In this article, we explored the use of PowerCLI to automate the VMware ESXi and VM STIGs. We discussed the installation requirements, provided example scripts, and highlighted the importance of customizing the scripts to meet specific environment needs.

**By leveraging PowerCLI and following the STIG guidelines, administrators can efficiently secure their VMware deployments and reduce manual effort while ensuring consistent configurations.**
