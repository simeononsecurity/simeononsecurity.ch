**Why You Should Assume Every Device Is Compromised**

In today's interconnected world, where technology permeates every aspect of our lives, cybersecurity is of paramount importance. The prevalence of cyber threats and the increasing sophistication of hackers make it essential to adopt a proactive mindset when it comes to device security. This article will discuss why you should assume every device is compromised and provide practical measures to enhance your digital security.

## The Illusion of Absolute Security

It is crucial to dispel the notion that any device or system is completely impervious to hacking or compromise. No matter how advanced the security measures implemented, there is always a possibility of vulnerability. By **assuming every device is already compromised**, you acknowledge the ever-present threat and take the necessary precautions to protect your sensitive information.

## Categories of Precautions

Assuming that every device is compromised compels you to adopt a comprehensive security approach. While the same basic rules of security apply whether a device is compromised or not, the mindset shift encourages heightened vigilance and better protection. Here are some essential measures to take, categorized for clarity:

### Secure Browsing Habits

1. [**Avoid visiting sketchy websites**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/tips-for-secure-e-commerce-transactions-and-safe-online-shopping/): Malicious websites can infect your device with malware or steal your personal information. Stick to trusted and reputable websites to minimize the risk of compromise.

2. [**Always verify website authenticity**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/tips-for-secure-e-commerce-transactions-and-safe-online-shopping/): Before entering login credentials or sharing sensitive information, verify the legitimacy of the website. Check for HTTPS protocol, look for trust indicators, and beware of phishing attempts.

### Personal Data Protection

1. [**Refrain from sharing personal details**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/safe-social-media-practices-and-protecting-your-privacy-online/): Be cautious about sharing sensitive personal information online. Identity theft is a significant concern, and minimizing the exposure of personal data reduces the chances of unauthorized access.

2. **Exercise caution with intimate content**: Never exchange explicit photos or videos online. These can be used for blackmail or revenge, leading to severe emotional distress and potential compromise.

### Strong Authentication and Password Practices

1. [**Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/what-are-the-diferent-kinds-of-factors-in-mfa/): Utilize 2FA whenever possible to add an extra layer of security. It combines something you know (password) with something you have (a mobile device or security key), significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

2. [**Use randomly generated passwords**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/how-to-create-strong-passwords/): Implement strong and unique passwords for all your accounts. Consider using a password manager to generate and securely store complex passwords.

### [Social Media Privacy](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/safe-social-media-practices-and-protecting-your-privacy-online/)

1. [**Minimize social media usage**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/safe-social-media-practices-and-protecting-your-privacy-online/): Limit your presence on social media platforms to reduce the exposure of personal information. Configure privacy settings to restrict access to your posts and profile.

### Secure Communication

1. [**Utilize secure communication apps**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/recommendations/messengers): Opt for secure communication apps such as [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) or [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) that employ end-to-end encryption, ensuring your messages remain confidential.

### Device Hygiene

1. **Keep software/apps to a minimum**: Limit the number of apps and software installed on your devices. Unnecessary applications increase the attack surface and can introduce vulnerabilities.

2. **Regularly factory reset devices**: Performing factory resets on your devices at regular intervals helps eliminate any potential malware or compromise. It ensures a clean slate for your device's security.

### Data Backup

1. [**Maintain backups**](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/what-is-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-and-why-you-should-use-it/): Create and maintain regular backups of your important data. Follow the [3-2-1 backup strategy](https://simeononsecurity.ch/articles/what-is-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-and-why-you-should-use-it/), which involves having three copies of your data, two on different mediums, and one stored off-site.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, adopting the mindset that every device is compromised empowers you to take the necessary precautions to safeguard your digital life. By following the recommended security measures in various categories, you significantly mitigate the risks associated with cyber threats. Remember to remain vigilant, stay informed about the latest security practices, and adapt your security measures accordingly.
