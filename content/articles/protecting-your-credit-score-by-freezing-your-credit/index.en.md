Your credit score is a critical aspect of your financial wellbeing. It has a significant impact on your ability to secure loans, obtain credit cards, and even rent a home. Given the crucial role that your credit score plays in your financial life, it's vital to take steps to protect it from fraud and identity theft.

## What is a Credit Freeze?

One of the most effective measures you can take to safeguard your credit score is to freeze your credit. A credit freeze restricts access to your credit report, making it difficult for anyone, whether a legitimate business or a fraudulent actor, to open new accounts in your name.

## Additional Steps to Protect Your Credit

While freezing your credit at the three major bureaus is an important first step in protecting your credit score, it's not the only step you should take. To achieve maximum protection from fraud and identity theft, it's recommended that you also freeze your credit at additional, lesser-known bureaus. For a comprehensive list of these bureaus and instructions on how to freeze your credit with each, you can refer to the resources available at [https://inteltechniques.com/freeze.html](https://inteltechniques.com/freeze.html). By taking these extra steps, you can ensure that your credit score is protected from abuse and that you can maintain control over your financial future.

## Other Ways to Protect Your Credit

In addition to freezing your credit, there are some other steps you can take to protect your credit score and prevent identity theft:

1. **Monitor your credit report:** Review your credit report regularly to check for any unauthorized activity or errors. You are entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every 12 months. You can request your reports at [www.annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com).
2. **Use strong passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all of your financial accounts and avoid using the same passwords for multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to create and store your passwords securely.
3. **Be careful with personal information:** Be cautious about sharing personal information, both online and offline. Avoid giving out sensitive information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details, unless it's necessary.
4. **Beware of phishing scams:** Be wary of unsolicited emails or phone calls that ask for personal information or try to convince you to click on a link or download an attachment. Scammers often use these tactics to steal personal information or install malware on your computer.
5. **Protect your devices:** Keep your computer, smartphone, and other devices up-to-date with the latest security updates and antivirus software. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions or entering personal information.
6. **Consider identity theft protection:** Some companies offer identity theft protection services that can help monitor your credit and alert you to suspicious activity. These services often come with a monthly fee, so consider whether it's worth the cost for your situation.

By following these steps, you can help protect your credit score and financial future from fraud and identity theft. It's important to be vigilant and proactive in safeguarding your personal information and staying aware of potential threats.
