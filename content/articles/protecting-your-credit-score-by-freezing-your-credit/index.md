# Protect Your Credit Score: The Importance of Freezing Your Credit

Your credit score is a critical aspect of your financial wellbeing. It has a significant impact on your ability to secure loans, obtain credit cards, and even rent a home. Given the crucial role that your credit score plays in your financial life, it's vital to take steps to protect it from fraud and identity theft.

One of the most effective measures you can take to safeguard your credit score is to freeze your credit. A credit freeze restricts access to your credit report, making it difficult for anyone, whether a legitimate business or a fraudulent actor, to open new accounts in your name.

To freeze your credit at the three major credit bureaus, follow these steps:

While freezing your credit at the three major bureaus is an important first step in protecting your credit score, it's not the only step you should take. To achieve maximum protection from fraud and identity theft, it's recommended that you also freeze your credit at additional, lesser-known bureaus.
