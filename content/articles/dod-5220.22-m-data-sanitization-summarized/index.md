# Department of Defense (DoD) 5220.22-M Specification For Drive Erasure

The Department of Defense (DoD) 5220.22-M specification is a standard for data sanitization that is widely used by the U.S. military and other government organizations. It was created to ensure that sensitive information is securely erased from digital storage media before it is disposed of or reused. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what the DoD 5220.22-M specification is, why it is important, and how it is used.

## What is the DoD 5220.22-M Specification?

The DoD 5220.22-M specification is a data sanitization standard that outlines the process of securely erasing data from digital storage media. It is designed to ensure that sensitive information is not recoverable by unauthorized individuals. The specification covers a wide range of digital storage media, including hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and removable media such as USB drives and floppy disks.

The DoD 5220.22-M specification requires the use of a multi-pass data sanitization process to ensure that all data is securely erased. The first pass of the process overwrites the data with a series of zeros, the second pass overwrites the data with a series of ones, and subsequent passes overwrite the data with random patterns. This process makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to recover the data that was stored on the media.

## Why is the DoD 5220.22-M Specification Important?

The DoD 5220.22-M specification is important because it helps to protect sensitive information that is stored on digital storage media. The U.S. military and other government organizations often handle sensitive information that needs to be protected, such as classified intelligence, personal information, and confidential financial data. If this information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could have serious consequences, including national security threats, financial fraud, and identity theft.

The DoD 5220.22-M specification helps to prevent these types of scenarios by providing a standard for securely erasing sensitive information from digital storage media. This ensures that the information is not recoverable by unauthorized individuals and cannot be used for malicious purposes.

## How is the DoD 5220.22-M Specification Used?

The DoD 5220.22-M specification is used by the U.S. military and other government organizations to ensure that sensitive information is securely erased from digital storage media before it is disposed of or reused. The specification is used by organizations to sanitize data from digital storage media that is being retired or decommissioned.

To comply with the DoD 5220.22-M specification, organizations must use data sanitization software that is capable of performing the multi-pass data sanitization process outlined in the specification. The software must be able to overwrite the data on the media with a series of zeros, ones, and random patterns. The software must also be able to verify that the data has been securely erased.

Organizations that use the DoD 5220.22-M specification must also maintain records of the data sanitization process, including the date and time that the process was performed, the type of media that was sanitized, and the method that was used. This information is important for auditing purposes and helps to ensure that the organization is in compliance with the DoD 5220.22-M specification.

## Conclusion

The DoD 5220.22-M specification is a critical standard for data sanitization that is used by the U.S.
