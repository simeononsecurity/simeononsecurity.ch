This comprehensive approach to workforce development plays a vital role in strengthening the DoD's cybersecurity posture and ensuring the protection of critical information systems.

#### Education:

- A **secondary education diploma or equivalent** is required for all **DoD Cyberspace Work Roles** at all proficiency levels.
- **Higher education** and **degree discipline requirements** are evaluated and enacted on a role-by-role basis, ensuring that individuals possess the necessary academic background for their specific cyberspace work role.
- In some cases, **continuous work experience** in the relevant discipline can be demonstrated as an alternative to a formal degree. This recognizes the value of practical, hands-on experience in the cyberspace domain.
- DoD Components are responsible for establishing processes to **document, review, validate, and approve continuous cyberspace work**, ensuring that individuals without formal degrees can showcase their expertise.
- When considering education qualifications, OSD and DoD Components are encouraged to leverage the expertise and guidance provided by **Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and National Security Agency (NSA) Centers of Academic Excellence**. These centers promote excellence in cybersecurity education and can offer valuable insights into educational requirements for cyberspace work roles.

By outlining the education requirements for each work role, the DoD Cyberspace Workforce Qualification and Management Program ensures that individuals have the necessary educational foundation to perform their assigned duties effectively. Whether through formal degrees or continuous work experience, education plays a critical role in developing a skilled and competent cyberspace workforce.
#### Training:

- **Training programs** within the DoD Cyberspace Workforce Qualification and Management Program must cover **70%** of the **core task and KSA content** of the work role, aligned with the applicable proficiency level. This ensures that individuals receive comprehensive training specific to their assigned cyberspace responsibilities.
- Approved training must be **completed within the past 5 years**, ensuring that individuals stay updated with the latest knowledge and skills in the rapidly evolving cyberspace domain. However, individuals with **continuous work experience** in the relevant discipline can demonstrate their ongoing competence without time restrictions.
- OSD and DoD Components are responsible for **documenting a list of acceptable training offerings** and their relevance to specific work roles and proficiency levels. These offerings are then submitted to the **Cyberspace Workforce Management Board (CWMB)** for inclusion in the appropriate work role qualification matrix. This centralized approval process ensures that training aligns with program requirements.
- It's important to note that **all external training offerings**, whether government-developed, sponsored, or commercial products, **require prior approval from the CWMB** to ensure compliance with the program's standards and criteria.
