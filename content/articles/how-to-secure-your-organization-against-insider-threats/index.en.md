Insider threats are a growing concern for organizations of all sizes. **Insider threats** are those caused by employees, contractors, or partners who have access to sensitive data and systems. These individuals can cause harm to an organization by stealing data, introducing malware, or compromising systems. In this article, we'll discuss best practices for securing your organization against insider threats.

## Introduction

The **introduction** is the first section of an article and sets the stage for what's to come. In this section, we'll discuss the importance of insider threat security and introduce the topics we'll be covering in the article.

Insider threats can be more difficult to detect and prevent than external threats. This is because insiders already have access to your systems and data, making it easier for them to steal or damage it. According to a study by Verizon, **60%** of insider threats were perpetrated by employees with **privileged access**.

To protect your organization against insider threats, you need a comprehensive security strategy that includes **policy development**, **training**, and **technical controls**. In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these areas.

__________

## Policy Development

**Policy development** is the process of creating policies that outline the expected behavior of employees, contractors, and partners. Policies should cover topics such as acceptable use of company resources, access control, and incident reporting. By having clear policies in place, employees will understand what is expected of them and what will happen if they violate policy.

**Policies** should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they are still relevant and effective. When developing policies, it's important to involve stakeholders from all areas of the organization. This ensures that the policies are comprehensive and take into account the needs of all departments.

Another important aspect of policy development is **enforcement**. Policies are only effective if they are enforced consistently and fairly. Organizations should have a process in place for reporting policy violations and should investigate and take appropriate action when violations occur.

__________

## Training

**Training** is an essential component of any security strategy. Employees, contractors, and partners should be trained on the organization's security policies and procedures. This includes topics such as password management, phishing awareness, and incident reporting.

Training should be provided to all new hires and should be repeated regularly for existing employees. This ensures that employees are up to date on the latest threats and know how to respond to them. In addition, organizations should provide targeted training to employees with privileged access to sensitive data and systems.

[**Security awareness**](https://simeononsecurity.com/articles/how-to-build-and-manage-an-effective-cybersecurity-awareness-training-program/) training can take many forms, including online courses, in-person training, and simulated phishing attacks. Organizations should choose the format that works best for their employees and should track training completion to ensure that all employees have received the necessary training.

__________

## Technical Controls

**Technical controls** are the technical measures that organizations put in place to prevent insider threats. These measures include access controls, monitoring systems, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

**Access controls** are used to limit access to sensitive data and systems. Organizations should use the principle of **least privilege** when granting access to employees, contractors, and partners. This means that employees should only be given the access they need to do their job, and no more.

**Monitoring systems** are used to detect suspicious activity on the organization's network. This includes activity such as accessing sensitive data outside of normal business hours or attempting to access data that the employee doesn't have permission to access.

**Data loss prevention (DLP)** solutions are used to prevent employees from exfiltrating sensitive data. DLP solutions can monitor outgoing network traffic and prevent employees from sending sensitive data outside of the organization.

## Conclusion

Insider threats can be a significant risk to organizations, but there are steps you can take to protect against them. By developing clear policies, providing comprehensive training, and implementing technical controls, you can reduce the risk of insider threats. Remember to review and update your security strategy regularly to stay ahead of evolving threats. With a proactive approach to security, you can keep your organization safe from insider threats.
