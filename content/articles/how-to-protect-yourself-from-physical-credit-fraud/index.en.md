**How to Protect Yourself from Physical Credit Card Fraud**

Credit cards have become an essential part of our daily lives. With the convenience they provide, however, comes the risk of fraud. Criminals have developed various techniques to steal credit card information, such as skimming, phishing, and hacking. In this article, we'll discuss how you can protect yourself from physical credit card fraud.

## Magnetic Strip

The magnetic strip on the back of your credit card contains all the necessary information for making a payment, including your name, card number, and expiration date. Criminals can use skimmers to steal this information when you use your card at an ATM or a payment terminal.

To protect yourself from this type of fraud:

- **Use payment terminals that are located in well-lit and populated areas**. Criminals are less likely to install skimmers in these locations.
- **Cover the keypad when entering your PIN**. This will prevent anyone from seeing your PIN.
- **Check the payment terminal for any signs of tampering**. If the terminal looks suspicious, use another one or pay with cash.
- **Regularly check your credit card statements** and report any suspicious transactions to your bank.
- **Only use credit cards for physical transactions**, debit cards don't have the same federal protections against fraud.

### Additional Tip: Avoid Cameras and Skimmers

As far as magnetic strip goes, don't let anyone take a picture of your card ever. Be very careful when using the magnetic strip. Be sure there are no cameras, or pinhole cameras that can see you enter your zip code or pin number. Wiggle the port around and if it wiggles, don't use it. 

If you want more of a guarantee, use a device like [Hunter-CAT](https://hackerwarehouse.com/product/hunter-cat/) to make sure there isn't one. 

## NFC Payment

NFC (Near Field Communication) payment allows you to make payments by tapping your credit card on a payment terminal. While this technology is convenient, it also creates an opportunity for criminals to steal your credit card information.

To protect yourself from this type of fraud:

- **Only enable NFC payment when you need to use it**. Keep it disabled otherwise.
- Use NFC payment terminals located in well-lit and populated areas.
- **Check your credit card statements regularly** and report any suspicious transactions to your bank.

### Additional Tip: Consider RFID Blocking Wallets

To protect yourself, get an actual **RFID blocking wallet**. [Silent pocket](https://amzn.to/421J6o6) is the only brand recommended. Most "RFID Blocking" wallets are a complete scam. simeononsecurity.com personally tested hundreds of wallets and supposed rfid blocking devices. Silent pocket is legit.

## Chip Technology

Most credit cards now come with **chip technology**, which provides an extra layer of security. The chip creates a unique code for each transaction, making it difficult for criminals to use stolen information to make purchases.

To protect yourself from this type of fraud:

- Use payment terminals that support chip technology.
- **Don't swipe your credit card** if a payment terminal supports chip technology. Always use the chip.
- Regularly **check your credit card statements** and report any suspicious transactions to your bank.

### Additional Tip: Keep Track of Your Chip Card

As far as the chips go, there are no known exploits or vulnerabilities leading towards cloning. So be sure not to lose your card as banks can use this against you.
