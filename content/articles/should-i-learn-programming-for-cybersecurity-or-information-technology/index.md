# Should You Learn Programming for IT and Cyber Security?

The field of IT and Cyber Security is rapidly growing, and with it, the demand for professionals who are skilled in the latest technologies and practices. While not all positions in these fields require coding or programming skills, having a solid understanding of these technologies can greatly benefit your career and increase your marketability. In this article, we'll explore why you should consider learning programming for IT and Cyber Security, and how to get started.

## Why Learn Programming for IT and Cyber Security?

Learning programming can greatly accelerate your career by multiplying the amount of work you can get done in a given time through automations. Automating tasks can save you time and reduce the risk of human error, which is especially important in the field of IT and Cyber Security. Additionally, coding and scripting skills are becoming increasingly sought after by employers, and can give you a competitive edge in the job market.

While it is not required to learn any sort of coding or scripting to be in IT or Cyber Security, the benefits far outweigh the effort to learn them. Once you get past the initial challenges, you'll find that it's almost always easier to do things through the command line and through scripting than it is any other way. This is because you can automate repetitive tasks and manage systems more efficiently, freeing up time to focus on more complex and important tasks.

## What Programming Languages Should You Learn?

When starting out in IT and Cyber Security, it's important to choose a language that is relevant and widely used in the industry. I personally recommend starting with either PowerShell (for Windows) or Bash (for Linux), as these are the two most commonly used scripting languages in the IT and Cyber Security fields. 

Once you have a solid foundation in PowerShell or Bash, you should consider learning Python. Python is a versatile and widely used language that is particularly well-suited for IT and Cyber Security tasks such as network automation, security testing, and data analysis. 

In addition to Python, you should also consider learning Ansible, Packer, and Terraform. Ansible is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate infrastructure deployment and management. Packer is a tool for creating machine images, and Terraform is a tool for infrastructure as code (IAC). These tools are widely used in the IT and Cyber Security fields, and having a strong understanding of them will greatly benefit your career.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, learning programming for IT and Cyber Security can greatly benefit your career and increase your marketability. While it may seem daunting at first, with practice and perseverance, you'll find that coding and scripting skills can greatly enhance your ability to perform tasks and solve problems in the field. Start by learning PowerShell or Bash, and then move on to Python and other relevant tools and technologies. With dedication and hard work, you'll be on your way to becoming a highly skilled and in-demand IT and Cyber Security professional.
