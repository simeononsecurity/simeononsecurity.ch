Cybersecurity and system administration are critical fields in today's digital age. As technology continues to advance, the need for experts who can secure systems and networks from cyber threats grows. But, do you really need a degree to work in these fields? Let's explore the pros and cons of having a degree in cybersecurity and system administration.

## Pros of Having a Degree

2. College Programs Provide Structure and Certifications

College programs in cybersecurity and system administration give you structure and require you to get certifications. This can be helpful if you're just starting out and need guidance on what to study. Certifications are a direct way to choose what you want to study, and many beginners go for **CompTIA's A+, Network+, and Security+** certifications to get started. These certifications can qualify you for a basic help desk job and are a good starting point for your career.

3. Increased Earnings

## Cons of Having a Degree

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the decision to get a degree in cybersecurity and system administration is a personal one and depends on your career goals and financial situation.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to continuously educate yourself and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field.

It's important to note that while having a degree in cybersecurity and system administration may be preferred in certain job positions, it doesn't guarantee success or job security in the field.
