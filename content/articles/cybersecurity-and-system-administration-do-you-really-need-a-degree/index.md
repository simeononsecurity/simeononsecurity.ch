# Cybersecurity and System Administration: Do You Really Need a Degree?

Cybersecurity and system administration are critical fields in today's digital age. As technology continues to advance, the need for experts who can secure systems and networks from cyber threats grows. But, do you really need a degree to work in these fields? Let's explore the pros and cons of having a degree in cybersecurity and system administration.

## Pros of Having a Degree

1. High Paying Government Jobs

Many high-paying government jobs in cybersecurity and system administration require at least a bachelor's degree. This is especially true for management positions, which often require a master's degree. Having a degree demonstrates your formal training and shows that you have a solid foundation in the field.

2. College Programs Provide Structure and Certifications

College programs in cybersecurity and system administration give you structure and require you to get certifications. This can be helpful if you're just starting out and need guidance on what to study. Certifications are a direct way to choose what you want to study, and many beginners go for CompTIA's A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications to get started. These certifications can qualify you for a basic help desk job and are a good starting point for your career.

3. Increased Earnings

On average, people with a college degree in cybersecurity and system administration stand to make about $20,000 more per year in government and government-adjacent positions. Having a degree can also open up more opportunities for career advancement and higher salaries.

## Cons of Having a Degree

1. Self-Taught Nature of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is often a self-taught field, and there is a lot of material online to help you learn. Almost every vendor provides some level of free training, and certifications are the more direct way for you to choose what you want to study.

2. Time and Cost

Getting a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity and system administration can take four years on average. In comparison, getting three certifications like CompTIA's A+, Network+, and Security+ can take only three to nine months for most people. Additionally, the cost of college can be significantly higher than getting certifications.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the decision to get a degree in cybersecurity and system administration is a personal one and depends on your career goals and financial situation. If you're just starting out and need guidance, a college degree can provide structure and certifications. However, if you're more self-motivated and prefer to learn on your own, certifications may be a better option. Ultimately, the most important thing is to continuously educate yourself and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field.
