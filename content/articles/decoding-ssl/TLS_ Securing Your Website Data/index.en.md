SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted between a client and a server.

SSL/TLS works through a series of steps:

1.  **Handshake**: The client and server establish a secure connection by exchanging cryptographic keys and verifying each other's identity.
2.  **Encryption**: Once the handshake is complete, SSL/TLS encrypts the data using symmetric encryption algorithms, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it.
3.  **Data Transfer**: The encrypted data is transmitted between the client and server, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
4.  **Decryption**: Upon receiving the encrypted data, the recipient uses the shared key to decrypt it and retrieve the original information.

SSL/TLS provides several important features:

*   **Authentication**: SSL/TLS verifies the identity of the server, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended party.
*   **Confidentiality**: The data transmitted over SSL/TLS is encrypted, preventing unauthorized access.
*   **Integrity**: SSL/TLS ensures that the data remains intact and unaltered during transmission.
*   **Forward Secrecy**: SSL/TLS uses ephemeral keys, which means that even if the private key is compromised, past communications cannot be decrypted.
