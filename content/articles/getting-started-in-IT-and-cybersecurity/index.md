# Getting Started in IT and Cybersecurity

Are you interested in a career in the fast-paced and ever-evolving field of IT and cybersecurity? Then you're in the right place. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps you need to take to get started on your journey.

## Starting in IT

Getting started in IT is the first step towards a career in cybersecurity. A basic help desk job or a system or network administration job will give you a solid foundation in the field. This will help you understand the basics of how IT and cybersecurity work, and you'll be better equipped to tackle the more complex challenges in cybersecurity. 

As the saying goes, you have to learn how to build it before you can learn how to break it. So, taking a job in IT will give you a hands-on experience that you wouldn't get otherwise. 

## Getting a Degree or Pursuing Certifications

While getting a degree in IT or cybersecurity is advisable, it's not the only way to get started. Pursuing CompTIA's A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications can give you a running start in the field and often let you know if you even want to pursue it further. These certifications are recognized by many employers, and they often transfer for college credit. Additionally, they cost significantly less than getting a degree.

## Advancing Your Skills

Once you have the CompTIA certifications, or at least the Security+ certification, you can start advancing your skills. Pursuing certifications like Microsoft's MCSA, CompTIA's Linux+, or Cisco's CCNA will prove that you have a bare minimum of administration skills and knowledge. These certifications will also make you a more competitive candidate for IT and cybersecurity jobs.

## Focusing on Cybersecurity

If you're set on pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you should look at getting either the pentest+ or CEH (preferred) certification. The CEH certification will give you a solid foundation in ethical hacking and penetration testing, and the OSCP certification is the next step for those who want to take their skills to the next level.

## Learning Scripting

Learning scripting is an important skill for anyone in the IT and cybersecurity field. However, it's probably not something you should start right away, especially if you're not sure if this is the field you want to be in. Once you have a solid foundation in IT and cybersecurity, you can start learning scripting to take your skills to the next level.

## Conclusion

Getting started in IT and cybersecurity can be a challenging journey, but with the right guidance, it can also be an exciting and rewarding one. Whether you decide to pursue a degree or certifications, the important thing is to get started and keep learning. Good luck!
