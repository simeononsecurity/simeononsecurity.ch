# How to Identify Phishing Emails, Texts, and Calls

In today's digital world, it is more important than ever to be able to identify **phishing** emails, texts, and calls. These fraudulent messages are designed to steal your personal information, such as your passwords, credit card numbers, or social security number. Here are some tips on how to identify phishing attempts, so you can keep your information safe.

## Remembering

When it comes to identifying phishing attempts, the first step is to **remember** that they exist. Phishing attempts are common and can be found in emails, texts, and phone calls. You should always be suspicious of any message that asks for personal information, even if it appears to be from a trusted source.

## Understanding

The next step is to **understand** the types of messages that are used in phishing attempts. There are a few common types, including:

- Emails that appear to be from a financial institution, asking you to update your account information
- Text messages that contain a link to a fake website, asking you to enter your login information
- Phone calls from people claiming to be from a company, asking for personal information

## Analyzing

When analyzing a message for signs of phishing, there are a few **key things** to look for. Here are some tips on how to identify phishing emails, texts, and calls.

### Phishing Emails

Phishing emails are designed to look like they are from a legitimate company, but they often have **tell-tale signs** that they are not. Here are some things to look for:

- The sender's email address is not from the company they claim to be from
- The email asks you to update your account information or provide personal information
- The email contains spelling or grammatical errors
- The email has a generic greeting, such as "Dear Customer," instead of your name
- The email contains a suspicious attachment or link

### Phishing Texts

Phishing texts are similar to phishing emails, but they often contain a **link** to a fake website. Here are some things to look for:

- The text asks you to click on a link to a website
- The website does not use a secure connection (https)
- The website asks you to enter your login information or personal information
- The website contains spelling or grammatical errors

### Phishing Calls

Phishing calls often come from **unknown numbers** or numbers that appear to be from a legitimate company. Here are some things to look for:

- The caller asks for personal information, such as your social security number or credit card number
- The caller claims to be from a company, but does not provide any proof
- The caller threatens you with legal action if you do not provide the requested information

## Applying

Now that you understand the types of messages used in phishing attempts, it's time to **apply** that knowledge. If you receive a message that fits one of these types, be suspicious. If the message is from a financial institution or other company, do not click on any links or provide any personal information. Instead, call the company's customer service line to verify the message's authenticity.

## Conclusion

Phishing attempts are common in today's digital world, but with these tips, you can learn how to identify them and keep your information safe.
