### Overview of PAT

Port Address Translation (PAT) is a crucial component of network address translation (NAT) that allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. PAT operates at the transport layer of the OSI model and is commonly used in scenarios where there is a shortage of public IP addresses.

PAT works by assigning unique port numbers to each communication session between a private IP address and a public IP address. This allows the router to keep track of which device the incoming packets belong to and correctly route the response packets back to the appropriate device.

Key points about PAT:

*   PAT enables the conservation of public IP addresses by multiplexing multiple private IP addresses onto a single public IP address.
*   It uses port numbers to differentiate between different communication sessions.
*   PAT can be implemented using either static or dynamic port allocation.
*   PAT introduces a level of security by hiding the private IP addresses of devices behind the public IP address.

In summary, PAT is a vital mechanism in NAT that enables the efficient use of public IP addresses and facilitates communication between devices on a private network and the internet.

### How PAT Works

[Port Address Translation (PAT)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l5wuJFoeVDQ&pp=ygULI3VubmF0XzQ2NDY%3D) is a technique used in network address translation (NAT) to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address. It allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address, which helps conserve IPv4 addresses. PAT works by assigning unique port numbers to each device within the private network, allowing the router to keep track of which device a specific packet belongs to. This way, when a packet is received from the internet, the router can correctly forward it to the appropriate device based on the port number.
