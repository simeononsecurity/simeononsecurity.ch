## Best Practices for Secure Coding Standards in Python

### 1. Input Validation

### Input Validation

User input is often a significant source of security risks. **Input validation** is the process of verifying that the user input meets the expected criteria and is safe to use in the application. 

For example, when a user enters a credit card number, the input should only contain digits and no special characters. To validate the input, developers can use built-in functions such as `isdigit()` or regular expressions to ensure that the input meets the expected criteria.

```python
import re

def validate_input(input_string):
    """
    Function to validate input using regular expressions.
    """
    pattern = r"^[0-9]+$"
    if re.match(pattern, input_string):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### 2. Avoid Using Unsafe Functions

Python has several functions that can be vulnerable to security issues if not used carefully. Functions such as `exec()`, `eval()`, and `pickle` can allow attackers to execute malicious code. Developers should **avoid using these functions** or use them with caution by restricting input parameters and using them only when necessary.

For example, instead of using `eval()` function to convert a string to an integer, developers should use the `int()` function.
```py
# Instead of using eval function
x = eval('10')

# Use int function
x = int('10')
```

### 3. Use Cryptography Libraries

**Cryptography libraries** such as [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) and [`pycryptodome`](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/) provide a secure way to perform encryption and decryption operations. Use these libraries instead of creating custom encryption methods, which may be prone to vulnerabilities.

For example, to encrypt a password, use the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library as follows:
```py
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_password(password):
    """
    Function to encrypt password using cryptography library.
    """
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    f = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_password = f.encrypt(password.encode('utf-8'))
    return encrypted_password

password = "mypassword"
encrypted_password = encrypt_password(password)
```
The `Fernet` object generates a key, which is used to encrypt the password using the `encrypt()` method.

### 4. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege

**The principle of least privilege** is a security best practice that restricts users or processes to the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. Developers should follow this principle when writing code to minimize the impact of security breaches.

For example, if an application requires read-only access to a database, it should use a database account with read-only permissions instead of an account with full permissions. This reduces the risk of an attacker exploiting the application to modify or delete data.

### 5. Keep Libraries and Frameworks Updated

Libraries and frameworks can contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Developers should **keep their libraries and frameworks updated** to the latest version to avoid potential security issues.

For example, if the application uses a third-party library, such as [`Requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), which has a security vulnerability, the developer should update to the latest version of the library that addresses the vulnerability.

### 6. Use a Static Code Analyzer

**A static code analyzer** is a tool that can identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code before it is executed. Use tools such as [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/), [`Pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/), and [`Pyflakes`](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/) to detect security issues in the code and fix them before deployment.

For example, [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) is a popular static code analyzer that examines Python code for potential security vulnerabilities. It can detect issues such as hard-coded passwords, SQL injection, and use of unsafe functions.

### 7. Use Secure Coding Practices for Web Applications

Web applications are vulnerable to several security risks such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and command injection. Developers should **follow secure coding practices** such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries to ensure that web applications are secure.

For example, when writing SQL queries, use **parameterized queries** instead of concatenating user input with the query. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data rather than executable code.

```py
# Instead of this
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "';"

# Use parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s;"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```
Developers should also **validate all user input**, encode output, and use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted over the network.

## Secure Coding Standards for Python Frameworks

Python frameworks such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) have their secure coding standards. Developers should follow these standards when developing applications using these frameworks. Here are some secure coding standards for Python frameworks:

### 1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a popular web framework for Python. Here are some secure coding standards for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/):

- Use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s built-in **authentication system** instead of creating a custom authentication system.
- Use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s built-in **password hashing functions** instead of creating custom password hashing methods.
- Use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s **template system** to ensure that the output is secure and free from cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

For example, to use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s built-in password hashing function, use the `make_password()` function from the `django.contrib.auth.hashers` module.

```python
from [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).contrib.auth.hashers import make_password

password = "mypassword"
hashed_password = make_password(password)
```

### 2. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a micro web framework for Python. Here are some secure coding standards for [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/):

- Use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)'s built-in **session management system** to ensure secure session handling.
- Use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)'s [`MarkupSafe`](https://pypi.org/project/MarkupSafe/) library to ensure that the output is secure and free from cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- Use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)'s [`WTForms`](https://pypi.org/project/WTForms/) library to handle user input validation and ensure that input is free from security risks.
- Use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)'s [`Blinker`](https://pypi.org/project/blinker/) library for secure signal handling.

For example, to use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)'s [`MarkupSafe`](https://pypi.org/project/MarkupSafe/) library, import it and use it to escape HTML tags from the output.
```py
from markupsafe import escape

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    name = "<script>alert('xss');</script>"
    return 'Hello, ' + escape(name)
```
