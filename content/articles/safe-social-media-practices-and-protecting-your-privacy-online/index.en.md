One common mistake that people make on social media is accepting **random friend requests**. It's important to exercise caution when receiving friend requests from unknown individuals. **Automated bots** and **profile scrapers** can use these requests to scam you or gather your personal information for malicious purposes. Instead, only accept friend requests from people you know and trust.

## Utilize privacy settings

Most social media platforms offer **privacy settings** that allow you to control the visibility of your personal information and posts. It is essential to take advantage of these settings to protect your privacy. Let's take a look at the privacy settings for some popular platforms:

- **LinkedIn**: LinkedIn provides several privacy options to control who can view your profile, connections, and activity. You can adjust these settings by visiting the [LinkedIn Privacy Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy) page.

## Avoid clicking on random links

Clicking on **random links** shared on social media can pose significant risks to your privacy and online security. These links may lead to **phishing websites** or contain malware that can compromise your device or steal your personal information. To protect yourself, refrain from clicking on suspicious links, especially if they are shared by unfamiliar or unverified sources.

## Stay away from surveys and polls

Participating in **surveys** or **polls** on social media platforms may seem harmless, but they can have privacy implications.
