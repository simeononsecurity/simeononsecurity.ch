## Test-taking Strategies

In addition to studying the exam objectives and using the recommended materials, there are a few test-taking strategies that can help you pass the SY0-601 exam:

- **Pace yourself**: You have 90 minutes to complete the exam, which means you should aim to spend no more than one minute per question. This will give you enough time to read and answer each question without feeling rushed. CompTIA exams let you go back and forward between questions. If you can't figure it out immediately, flag the question, come back to it later. 
- **Eliminate wrong answers**: If you are unsure of an answer, try to eliminate any obviously incorrect options to improve your chances of selecting the correct answer. CompTIA commonly likes to give two wrong answers and two right answers to trip people up with existing experience. Eliminate two off the bat and carefully consider the remaining answers. 
- **Read carefully**: Read each question and answer option carefully to ensure that you fully understand what is being asked. Don't rush through the questions, as this can lead to misinterpretation and incorrect answers. Be aware that CompTIA likes to trip you up with double negatives and specifics.
- **Review your answers**: Once you have completed the exam, if you have time, review any questions you've left unanswered. 


## Tips for Passing the Exam

1. **Start with the exam objectives**: The exam objectives provide a clear outline of the topics you need to study. Use this as a guide to focus your study efforts.
   
2. **Create a study plan**: Develop a study plan that includes specific goals and deadlines. This will help you stay organized and on track.
   
3. **Use a variety of study resources**: Don't rely solely on one study resource. Use a combination of official study materials, third-party resources, and study groups to gain a comprehensive understanding of the exam material.
   
4. **Practice, practice, practice**: Take as many practice exams and performance-based questions as possible. This will help you become familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need to focus your study efforts.
