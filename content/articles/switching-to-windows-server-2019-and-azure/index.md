## Introduction:

In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations are always looking for ways to improve their IT infrastructure and keep up with the latest technological advancements. As a result, many organizations are faced with the decision of whether to upgrade their current server or switch to a cloud-based solution. This article will explore the reasons why organizations should consider upgrading their server to Server 2019 or switching to Azure.

### Why Upgrade to Server 2019?

1. **Enhanced Security**: Server 2019 includes several security enhancements that make it more secure than its predecessor, Server 2012. For example, it includes Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), which is a comprehensive security solution that helps protect against sophisticated cyber threats.

2. **Improved Performance**: Server 2019 includes many performance improvements over Server 2012. For example, it includes support for faster storage technologies such as NVMe and improved support for high-performance computing workloads.

3. **Better Integration with Azure**: Server 2019 is designed to work seamlessly with Azure, making it easier for organizations to move their on-premise workloads to the cloud. This integration allows organizations to take advantage of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of Azure while still maintaining control over their on-premise infrastructure.

4. **Long-Term Support**: Server 2019 will receive support from Microsoft until 2029, which means organizations can continue to receive security updates and bug fixes for a longer period of time. In comparison, Server 2012 will only receive support until 2023, after which organizations will no longer receive security updates or bug fixes.

### Why Switch to Azure?

1. **Scalability**: Azure is a highly scalable cloud platform that allows organizations to quickly and easily scale their IT infrastructure as their needs change. This means organizations can respond quickly to changing business needs without having to worry about the limitations of their on-premise infrastructure.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Azure is a cost-effective solution for organizations of all sizes. By eliminating the need for hardware and software maintenance, organizations can reduce their IT costs and focus on growing their business.

3. **Increased Reliability**: Azure is designed for high availability and disaster recovery, which means organizations can be confident that their data is always available and protected, even in the event of a disaster.

4. **Advanced Analytics**: Azure includes advanced analytics tools, such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics, that allow organizations to quickly and easily gain insights into their data. This can help organizations make better-informed business decisions and improve their overall competitiveness.

### Why not do both?

It's worth mentioning that organizations don't have to choose between upgrading to Server 2019 or switching to Azure. In fact, many organizations choose to do both, as they can complement each other and provide the best of both worlds. For example, an organization can run critical business applications on Server 2019 on-premise for improved control and security, while also taking advantage of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of Azure for non-critical workloads. This hybrid approach allows organizations to maximize the benefits of both solutions and create a flexible and resilient IT infrastructure that can adapt to changing business needs.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, organizations should consider upgrading to Server 2019 or switching to Azure because both solutions offer improved security, performance, integration, and support. By taking advantage of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of Azure or the enhanced security and performance of Server 2019, organizations can improve their IT infrastructure and stay ahead of the competition.
