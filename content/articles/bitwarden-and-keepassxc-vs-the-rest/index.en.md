## Conclusion

In conclusion, password managers are an essential tool for anyone who uses the internet. They help us keep track of our login credentials and keep our accounts secure. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a solid choice for those looking for a password manager with encryption and two-factor authentication features, as well as an easy-to-use interface. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) is a great option for those who prioritize security and offline functionality. Additionally, there are other password managers such as [1Password](https://1password.com/), [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), and [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) that offer similar features and may be better suited for certain individuals or use cases. However, we do strongly recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) for their overall functionality, device support, and free tier functionality.

It's important to note that using the password managers built into your browser is insecure, and there are malware and viruses designed to capture these databases which are left relatively unsecure on your operating system. It's crucial to use E2E zero-knowledge providers and software for storing passwords wherever possible, and to always enable two-factor authentication.

Remember, the most important thing is to choose a password manager that fits your needs and preferences. By doing so, you can ensure that your accounts remain secure and your login credentials are easy to manage
