However, we do strongly recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) for their overall functionality, device support, and free tier functionality.

It's crucial to use E2E zero-knowledge providers and software for storing passwords wherever possible, and to always enable two-factor authentication.

Remember, the most important thing is to choose a password manager that fits your needs and preferences. By doing so, you can ensure that your accounts remain secure and your login credentials are easy to manage
