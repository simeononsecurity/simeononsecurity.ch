# Today I learned / Read About...
**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

SimeonOnSecurity is a person who has a keen interest in security and privacy and has come across several resources today that they found interesting and would like to share with others.

One of the resources that caught their attention is the "Awesome Security" list on GitHub. This list contains an extensive collection of awesome security tools and SimeonOnSecurity plans to continue exploring and learning about the items on this list.

Another resource that they found interesting is the "PSScriptAnalyzer". This is a static code checker for PowerShell modules and scripts, and SimeonOnSecurity plans to integrate it into their workflow for developing modules and scripts.

SimeonOnSecurity also came across the "personal-security-checklist" on GitHub and found it to be a valuable resource for people who are just starting to take their privacy and security seriously. Although they have some criticisms about the resource, they might create their own version in the future.

The "Awesome Selfhosted" list on GitHub was another resource that caught SimeonOnSecurity's attention. This list contains an extensive collection of awesome self-hosted tools and software, and they plan to continue exploring and learning about the items on this list.

For those who are interested in setting up a home lab, SimeonOnSecurity came across two solutions: "HomelabOS" and "DockSTARTer". Both of these solutions provide a simplified way to deploy self-hosted services, but SimeonOnSecurity thinks that HomelabOS has better support. Another solution that they found is "FreedomBox", which is a private server for non-experts, making it easy for people to install and configure server applications with just a few clicks.

Finally, SimeonOnSecurity came across the "privacy-respecting" list on GitHub created by nikitavoloboev, which contains a great list of privacy-respecting services and software. They already recommend some of the linked items and plan to continue exploring and learning about the items on this list.

In conclusion, SimeonOnSecurity has come across several interesting resources today that they believe would be useful to others who are interested in security and privacy.


## Awesome Security:
- [https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)
- A great list of awesome security tools. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.

## PSScriptAnalyzer:
- [https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)
- A static code checker for PowerSell Modules and scripts. I plan on working with it into my module and script development workflow.

## personal-security-checklist:
- [https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist)
- A great resource to send to people beginning to take privacy and security seriously. I have some criticisms and potentially I'll make my own version.

## Awesome Selfhosted:
- [https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)
- A great list of awesome self-hosted tools and software. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.

## HomelabOS:
- [https://homelabos.com/](https://homelabos.com/)
- An interesting HomeLab setup making home services really eazy to set up. I'm not a fan of self-hosting. But something like this makes for an eazy set up for lightly-technical users. I might recommend this to some people. I don't personally wish to use something like it. All-in-one packages are generally harder to lock-down and secure.

## DockSTARTer:
- [https://dockstarter.com/](https://dockstarter.com/)
- Similar to HomeLabOS (above), provides a simplified way to deploy self-hosted services and has some future potential. HomelabOS seems to have better support. 

## FreedomBox:
- [https://freedombox.org/](https://freedombox.org/)
- FreedomBox is a private server for non-experts: it lets you install and configure server applications with only a few clicks. It runs on cheap hardware of your choice, uses your internet connection and power, and is under your control. 
- Similar to both HomeLabOS and DockSTARTer, FreedomBox is a solution to self-host privacy-oriented services rapidly.

## nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting:
- [https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting)
- A great list of privacy respecting services and software. I already [recommend](https://simeononsecurity.ch/recommendations) some of the linked items. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.
