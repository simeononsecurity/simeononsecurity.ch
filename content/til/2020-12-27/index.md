# Today I learned / Read About...
**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

## Awesome Security
- [https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)

A great list of awesome security tools. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.


## PSScriptAnalyzer
- [https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)

A static code checker for PowerSell Modules and scripts. I plan on working with it into my module and script development workflow.


## personal-security-checklist 
- [https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist)

A great resource to send to people beginning to take privacy and security seriously. I have some criticisms and potentially I'll make my own version.


## Awesome Selfhosted
- [https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)

A great list of awesome self-hosted tools and software. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.

## HomelabOS
- [https://homelabos.com/](https://homelabos.com/)
An interesting HomeLab setup making home services really eazy to set up. I'm not a fan of self-hosting. But something like this makes for an eazy set up for lightly-technical users.
I might recommend this to some people. I don't personally wish to use something like it. All-in-one packages are generally harder to lock-down and secure.

## DockSTARTer
- [https://dockstarter.com/](https://dockstarter.com/)
Similar to HomeLabOS (above), provides a simplified way to deploy self-hosted services and has some future potential. HomelabOS seems to have better support. 


## nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting 
- [https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting)
A great list of privacy respecting services and software. I already [recommend](https://simeononsecurity.ch/recommendations) some of the linked items. I plan to continue reading into the items in the list.
