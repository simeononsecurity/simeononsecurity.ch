# Today I learned / Read About...
**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

Today, SimeonOnSecurity learned about using conditionals in Ansible and managing variables. He found several resources to help deepen his understanding of the topic, including official Ansible documentation and articles from tech bloggers.

SimeonOnSecurity learned about using the "when" clause to execute a task only when certain conditions are met, and how to use privilege escalation through the "become" directive. He also delved into the topic of Ansible OS families and how to specify the operating system for a playbook.

SimeonOnSecurity's studies covered a range of topics, from the basics of conditionals to more advanced topics such as managing privileges and specifying the target operating system. By utilizing these resources, he will be able to write more effective and efficient Ansible playbooks.
