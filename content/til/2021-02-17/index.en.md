**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

SimeonOnSecurity has updated a page on his website and learned about a few resources that he finds interesting. The updated page is the writeup for the Invite Challenge on HackTheBox. This page provides an in-depth analysis of the process of solving the challenge on both Windows and Linux systems.

In addition to the updated page, SimeonOnSecurity also discovered some useful learning resources. One of these resources is a blog post by Cameron Nokes that focuses on working with JSON in bash using the jq tool. The jq tool is a command-line utility that makes it easy to parse, filter, and manipulate JSON data.

Another two resources are related to the conversion of JSON data in PowerShell. The Microsoft documentation provides information on the ConvertFrom-Json and ConvertTo-Json cmdlets. These cmdlets make it possible to convert JSON data into and from PowerShell objects, allowing for easier manipulation and analysis of the data.
