**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

Today, SimeonOnSecurity updated his repository Windows-Defender-Application-Control-Hardening and learned about Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), a feature of Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2019 that provides security by controlling what is executed on a device.

SimeonOnSecurity delved into the Microsoft documentation on WDAC and discovered several key resources for creating and deploying policies. He learned about how to create a WDAC policy for fixed-workload devices using a reference computer, how to deploy WDAC policies using script, and how to use multiple policies for different scenarios.

Additionally, SimeonOnSecurity gained insight into the guidance on creating WDAC deny policies, allowing him to better understand the concept of allowing only trusted applications to run on a device, while denying all others.

Overall, SimeonOnSecurity's exploration into Windows Defender Application Control further solidified his understanding of the importance of application control in modern security practices.
