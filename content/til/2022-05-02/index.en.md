**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and automation using Ansible.

First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Windows_STIG_Ansible repository provides a complete solution for configuring Windows systems to meet Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, using the Ansible automation platform. The windows_stigs repository is a collection of Ansible roles for configuring Windows systems to meet STIG requirements, and it is available on Ansible Galaxy, a central repository for sharing Ansible content.

SimeonOnSecurity also found several learning resources related to Windows automation with Ansible. The ansible.windows.win_copy module documentation provides information on how to copy files on Windows systems using Ansible. The ansible blocks documentation provides information on how to use blocks, a powerful feature of Ansible that allows you to group multiple tasks together and apply conditional execution. The ansible galaxy user guide provides information on how to use Ansible Galaxy, and the ansible installing content documentation provides information on how to install content from Ansible Galaxy.
