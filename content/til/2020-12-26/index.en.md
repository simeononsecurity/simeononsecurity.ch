**What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today**

Today, SimeonOnSecurity came across two interesting and useful security and privacy related tools: Universal Android Debloater and DeepPrivacy.

The Universal Android Debloater is a bash script using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to debloat non-rooted Android devices. This tool can help to improve privacy, security and battery life of your device by removing unwanted apps and bloatware. You can find the Universal Android Debloater at https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater.

DeepPrivacy is a fully automatic anonymization technique for images. This tool can help to keep sensitive information private, for example by obscuring faces in photos or removing personal identification information. DeepPrivacy can be found at https://github.com/hukkelas/DeepPrivacy.

SimeonOnSecurity plans to continue exploring these tools and finding other interesting tools to share with the community.
