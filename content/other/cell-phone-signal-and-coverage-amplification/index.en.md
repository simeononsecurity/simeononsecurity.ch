**Boosting Your Cell Signal in Remote Locations**

Staying connected has become a necessity for most of us, especially during the pandemic. However, in remote locations, getting a reliable cell signal can be challenging. Fortunately, there are various options available for boosting your cell signal. In this article, we will discuss indoor cell boosters like the T-Mobile Cell Spot, outdoor to indoor boosters like those from WeBoost and Hiboost, and femtocell options for AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon.

## [T-Mobile Cell Spot](https://amzn.to/41cXppc)

The [T-Mobile Cell Spot](https://amzn.to/41cXppc) is a device that comes with a window unit and a coverage unit. You can rent it for free from T-Mobile or get it for free. Otherwise, you can [buy one on Amazon outright for around $25 - $50](https://amzn.to/41cXppc). It only helps if you have good or usable coverage in or near a window and not in another area of the house. It works best if you just need to spread coverage through a dwelling more evenly. 

They are produced by a company called [Cell-Fi](https://nextivityinc.com/products/) and they have other options available, but they are significantly more expensive. While this Cell Spot will work for T-Mobile (and their MVNO customers like Mint Mobile), there are other better options that have options and or support for other carriers available that we will discuss below.

## [WeBoost](https://amzn.to/42chuNG) and [Hiboost](https://amzn.to/3NPsSL6)

The [WeBoost](https://amzn.to/42chuNG) and [Hiboost](https://amzn.to/3NPsSL6) options require some installation. They require you to install a pole, grounding rod, lighting arrestor, amp, and one or more indoor antennas. They offer the best possible signal but won't work if there is no signal in your area whatsoever. They average around 60db of additional gain but can go up to 100db. This is definitely the best permanent solution as you'll get the most signal improvement possible as well as support for all carriers at the same time. 

We recommend the following options for whole-home amplification:

- [WeBoost](https://amzn.to/42chuNG) - $590
- [Hiboost](https://amzn.to/3NPsSL6) - $399

Both of our recommendations offer whole-home amplification, but purchasing extra indoor antennas is advisable in some situations.

## Femtocell Options

**Femtocell options are great if you need cell coverage and already have reliable internet** and or your your carrier doesn't support Wi-Fi calling. 
They act like your own miniature cell tower.
They work best when you have no existing cell coverage in the area.
The downside is that **you don't get to choose which devices are able to connect to the femtocell**. This means all cell devices that connect to it will be using your internet bandwidth. But all communications are secured ipsec vpn back to the carrier. So they are relatively secure in that regard. 
Additionally, cell phone coverage providers offer these, **requiring upfront payment of around $300** but can go higher depending on how many devices you need to support.

- [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/products/verizon-lte-network-extender/)
- [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/support/coverage/4g-lte-cellspot) - Requires a phone call or going to a T-Mobile store to order one

Meanwhile, you can [get them on eBay for around $50-$150](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=femtocell) depending on which model you want and which carrier you need to support. Most carriers require registration of the device, however.

Lastly, some FemtoCell devices require registration:
