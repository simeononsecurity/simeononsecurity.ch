In today's digital age, search engines have become an essential tool for everyone's online activities. Google is, without a doubt, the most popular and widely used search engine globally. However, Presearch is a search engine platform that is gradually gaining popularity, and it offers an alternative to Google.

## What is Presearch?

Presearch is an open-source, decentralized search engine platform that rewards its users for their searches using cryptocurrency. It is designed to provide an alternative to centralized search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Presearch aims to build a more transparent and community-driven search engine ecosystem that puts users' privacy and preferences at the forefront.

## How Presearch Works

Presearch is built on blockchain technology, and its native cryptocurrency is PRE. When you search on the Presearch platform, you earn PRE tokens. Presearch rewards its users for their searches as a way of incentivizing them to use the platform. The more you use Presearch, the more PRE tokens you earn. The PRE tokens can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

The platform is community-driven, and users can earn more tokens by contributing to the ecosystem. For example, you can earn tokens by creating new search engines, adding keywords to existing search engines, or referring new users to the platform.

## Presearch vs. Google

Google's popularity comes from its speed, accuracy, and the range of services it offers. It dominates the search engine market with an over 90% share of the global search engine market. However, there are several reasons why you might consider Presearch as an alternative to Google:

- **Privacy:** Presearch offers a more private search experience. Google tracks your search history and other online activities, which can be used to target ads. Presearch does not track your searches or sell your data to advertisers.

- **Decentralized:** Presearch is decentralized, which means it is not controlled by a single entity. This makes it less vulnerable to censorship and other forms of control that centralized platforms like Google are subject to.

- **Transparency:** Presearch is open-source, which means anyone can see how the platform works. This makes it more transparent than closed-source platforms like Google.

- **Rewards:** Presearch rewards users with its native cryptocurrency, PRE, for their searches. This incentivizes users to use the platform and contribute to the ecosystem.

## Presearch Focuses

### Privacy

Presearch puts privacy at the forefront of its platform. Unlike Google, Presearch does not collect users' search data and personal information. Presearch also does not track users across the internet or use their data for advertising purposes. Therefore, users can search with peace of mind, knowing that their privacy is secure.

### Community-driven

Presearch is community-driven, and its users contribute to the development and growth of the platform. Users can create new search engines, add keywords, and even vote on changes to the platform. This level of community involvement ensures that the platform remains transparent and serves its users' needs.

### Decentralized

Presearch is built on blockchain technology, making it decentralized. This means that no single entity controls the platform, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation. Decentralization also ensures that the platform remains open, transparent, and free from external influences.

### Rewarding

Presearch rewards its users for their searches, which is not the case with Google. Users earn PRE tokens, which can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. This incentivizes users to use the platform, contributing to its growth and development.

## Features of Presearch

### Ad-free

Presearch does not display ads on its platform. This is because the platform is community-driven, and users contribute to its growth and development. Presearch also aims to provide a distraction-free environment for its users, making it ideal for those who value their privacy and do not want to be bombarded with ads.

### Customizable

Presearch allows users to customize their search experience. Users can create their own search engines, add keywords to existing engines, and even vote on changes to the platform. This level of customization ensures that users can tailor their search experience to their specific needs.

### Open-source

Presearch is open-source, meaning that anyone can access its code and contribute to its development. This ensures that the platform remains transparent and that users can trust its operations.

## Conclusion

Presearch is an excellent alternative to Google, especially for those who value their privacy and want a more community-driven and transparent search engine ecosystem. With its focus on privacy, customization, and community involvement, Presearch presents a compelling alternative to centralized search engines like Google.

If you are looking for a search engine that respects your privacy, values community participation, and rewards you for your searches, then Presearch is an excellent option to consider. Try it out today and experience a new way of searching the web.
