**Crankk vs Helium IoT**

In the world of Internet of Things (IoT), connectivity is crucial. As the demand for IoT devices continues to grow, so does the need for efficient and reliable wireless networks. Two prominent players in the IoT connectivity space are Crankk and Helium IoT. In this article, we will compare these two platforms and explore their features, benefits, and differences.

## Introduction

______

**Crankk** and **Helium IoT** are both decentralized wireless networks that aim to provide connectivity for IoT devices. These networks utilize low-power, long-range wireless technologies, such as LoRaWAN, to enable IoT device communication over extended distances. While they share similarities in terms of their wireless protocols, there are notable differences in their approaches and offerings.

## Network Architecture

______

**Crankk** operates on the Kadena Network, a scalable and secure blockchain platform. It leverages a consensus group of nodes for witness validation and employs Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) to ensure the integrity of the network. This architecture enhances security and reduces the risk of collusion between consensus nodes and witnesses. Crankk's decentralized approach allows for greater transparency and eliminates the need for a central authority.

On the other hand, **Helium IoT** uses a peer-to-peer architecture called "The People's Network." It relies on a global network of hotspots, which are physical devices that provide connectivity to IoT devices. These hotspots mine HNT (Helium Network Token) by validating wireless coverage and relaying data. The peer-to-peer architecture offers a decentralized and community-driven approach to IoT connectivity.

## Witness Validation and Security

______

In Crankk, witness validation plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data. Witnesses validate information using a TTP, which eliminates the possibility of nodes lying about received pings. The TTP can also perform comprehensive checks and comparisons of radio reception parameters. This multi-TTP approach reduces the risk of collusion among consensus nodes and witnesses.

Helium IoT, on the other hand, relies on the hotspot network for witness validation. Hotspots mine HNT by proving coverage and relaying data. While this approach incentivizes network participation, the witness validation process may be more susceptible to manipulation as it relies on the honesty of hotspot operators.

## Gas Fees and Token Economics

______

In Crankk, gas fees are paid in Kadena (KDA), the native token of the Kadena Network. The network calculates the minimum gas fee for operations, ensuring users pay the minimum acceptable fee. Additionally, Crankk's smart contracts optimize the use of Kadena as a key/value database, reducing the required minimum fee. To cover gas fees, Crankk provides a complementary balance of Kadena with every gateway purchase.

Helium IoT has its native token called HNT. Hotspot owners mine HNT by providing network coverage and relaying data. The earned HNT can be used for various purposes within the Helium ecosystem. The token economics of Helium IoT rely on the participation and mining efforts of the community.

## Mining Hardware and Options

______

Crankk's "mining" hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi with a LoRa radio module. This energy-efficient device operates similarly to a Wi-Fi router, consuming minimal energy. Crankk aims to democratize access to both hardware and software, allowing users to build their own hardware and self-install the software once the network's viability is proven. The initial offering includes an indoor enclosure with a basic antenna, and users have the option to upgrade to a larger antenna if needed. They can also choose to dual mine with a selection of approved helium devices. 

Helium IoT offers a different approach to mining hardware. Hotspots serve as the mining hardware in the Helium network. These hotspots are specialized devices equipped with LoRaWAN radios and cryptographic elements. Helium sells its own branded hotspot device called "Helium Hotspot," which can be purchased and operated by users. Additionally, third-party manufacturers also offer compatible hotspot devices that can be used on the Helium network.

## Buying Options and Hosted Solutions

______

Crankk provides two buying options for users. The first option is to purchase two miners, which will be shipped to the user within 2-3 weeks. This option allows users to start earning tokens right away and ensures coverage for their Crankk gateway. The second option is to buy a single "hosted" miner. In this case, the user still owns the miner, but Crankk will host it until the user decides to take over custody. The hosted option eliminates the need for the user to manage the hardware and ensures hassle-free operation.

Helium IoT offers a similar approach, allowing users to purchase and operate their own hotspots. Users can buy Helium Hotspots directly from Helium or choose from third-party manufacturers. Once the hotspot is set up and connected to the Helium network, users can start mining HNT and participating in the ecosystem.

## Coverage and Expansion

______

Coverage is a crucial aspect of any wireless network. Crankk aims to expand its network coverage by encouraging users to set up their own gateways. The decentralized nature of Crankk allows for the proliferation of gateways, enhancing coverage and network resilience. As more users join and set up their own Crankk gateways, the network coverage and availability will continue to grow.

Helium IoT focuses on building a global network of hotspots to provide coverage. By leveraging the hotspot mining incentive, Helium aims to create a decentralized and community-driven network that spans across different geographical locations. The more hotspots that join the network, the broader the coverage becomes, benefiting IoT devices seeking connectivity.


## Conclusion

______

Both Crankk and Helium IoT offer unique approaches to decentralized IoT connectivity. Crankk leverages the Kadena Network and a consensus group of nodes to ensure security and integrity. On the other hand, Helium IoT relies on a peer-to-peer network of hotspots for witness validation and mining HNT. Each platform has its strengths and benefits, and users should consider their specific requirements when choosing between the two.

As the demand for IoT connectivity continues to grow, Crankk and Helium IoT are poised to play significant roles in shaping the future of IoT networks. Whether it's through Crankk's emphasis on transparency and security or Helium IoT's community-driven hotspot network, both platforms contribute to the expansion of the IoT ecosystem.
