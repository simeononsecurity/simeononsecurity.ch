## Introduction

Cryptocurrency mining continues to evolve, and the WingBits technology stack offers an accessible pathway for enthusiasts. In this guide, we'll explore the hardware requirements, ADSB-specific equipment, and step-by-step instructions for setting up your WingBits mining rig. Whether you're diving into mining for the first time or optimizing your current setup, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process, from selecting the right hardware to fine-tuning gain levels. Let's embark on a journey to efficient and budget-friendly cryptocurrency mining with WingBits.

## Hardware Requirements:
### System Requirements:
One of the following is required. We basically just need any efficient and low powered computer we can get our hands on. Any Raspberry PI, Intel NUC, or similar will do. They don't have to be all that powerful. However I will recommend you have at least 32g-64g of storage, 4g of ram, and at least 2 cpu threads. For this we will be targeting a budget of around $100-$200 for hardware but feel free to go higher if it suits your needs. Our power target is 25w or better on average.
#### Raspberry Pi:
Hard to get ahold of these days but they are super low power and are quite customizable.

## Setup Instructions for Installing WingBits

Wingbits technology stack currently operates like this.

 `readsb` -> `vector` -> `wingbits`

To get started is simple, just follow these steps:

### 1. Run the WingBits setup script by using the command:
```bash
curl -sL https://gitlab.com/wingbits/config/-/raw/master/download.sh | sudo bash
```
> **Note**: *Make sure you have your device ID, which you can find in your original WingBits email or on the [WingBits dashboard](https://wingbits.com).*

### **2: Setting Up Your Location**
Setting your mining location is crucial. Use tools like [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html) to find the coordinates for your installation site. Replace the example coordinates with your own:
```bash
sudo readsb-set-location 50.12344 10.23429
```

### **3: Optimizing Gain Levels**
Now, it's time to optimize your receiver's gain levels. Run the following command, if it fails, come back to this step after a few minutes.

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -L -o - https://github.com/wiedehopf/adsb-scripts/raw/master/autogain-install.sh)" hash -r
sudo autogain1090
# Run ever 2 minutes, in the background, for an hour to optimize gain even further
sudo for i in {0..30}; do sudo autogain1090; sleep 120; done &
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the setup of your WingBits mining system! By now, you've configured your hardware, fine-tuned your ADSB receiver, and optimized gain levels for maximum efficiency. Remember, cryptocurrency mining requires careful consideration of hardware, location, and market volatility. Always stay informed and adapt your strategy as needed. With your WingBits mining rig up and running, you're well-positioned to explore the exciting world of digital currency. Happy mining!
