XNET Carrier Offload incorporates several sophisticated security protocols designed to ensure the security and privacy of carrier traffic, particularly focusing on the encryption of calls, SMS, and MMS.

#### Encrypted Carrier Traffic
All mobile carrier traffic that passes through XNET, including voice calls, SMS, and MMS, is securely tunneled through a VPN provided by the cellular carrier. This VPN ensures that all such communications are **encrypted at all times**, safeguarding the privacy and security of sensitive information transmitted over the network. This arrangement is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of user communications, particularly in environments where network security cannot be guaranteed.

#### HTTPS for General Traffic
Aside from carrier-specific communications, the rest of the traffic from mobile devices relies on HTTPS for encryption. HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's device and the site. Users can rest assured that their browsing activities and data transfers are secured through this protocol, even when connected to public Wi-Fi networks like those provided by XNET.

#### Network Isolation and Visibility
The configuration of XNET access points (APs) is specifically designed to enhance security by isolating them from local network devices. This means that while connected to an XNET AP, your device will not be able to see other local devices on the network. Conversely, other devices cannot see your device, although they are technically on the same network. This isolation helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches within the network.

#### Advanced User Options for Increased Security
Although XNET APs provide a basic level of security, users with higher security needs can take additional measures if their network hardware supports it:
- **VLANs**: Implementing Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) can further segment the network, creating isolated networks within the broader network that can help control which devices and traffic can communicate with each other.
- **Firewall Rules**: Setting up advanced firewall rules can provide an additional layer of security, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

#### Public Internet Access
Importantly, XNET APs are configured to only require access to the public internet and do not need to interact with local network resources. This design minimizes the risk of internal network threats and simplifies the network setup, focusing solely on providing secure, reliable internet access to users.

By implementing these protocols, XNET ensures that all carrier communications remain secure and private, while also providing flexible options for users and organizations that require enhanced network security measures.

#### **Use of Public IP and VLAN Settings**: 

XNET systems are designed to operate within a public IP framework, which enhances accessibility and integration with existing network infrastructures. However, this also necessitates rigorous security measures. The use of **private space and DHCP configurations on VLAN** ensures that each device connected through XNET has a unique network identity, thereby minimizing potential IP conflicts and enhancing network security.
  
#### **Authentication and Logging**: 

Authentication is a critical aspect of security for XNET. Each device that connects to the network must be authenticated to ensure that it is authorized to use the XNET service. This is typically managed through digital certificates provided by the cellular carriers, as part of the Wi-Fi Passpoint standard. **Logging of user activities** is also conducted meticulously to ensure a trail of data usage and system access, which is vital for auditing and addressing any potential security incidents.

### Content Filtering and DNS Providers
- **DNS Filtering**: To further secure the network against malicious activities, **content filtering DNS providers** are recommended. These providers help filter out harmful or suspicious websites by blocking the DNS lookup that would normally enable users to access such sites. This is particularly important in public Wi-Fi networks like those managed by XNET, where users might inadvertently access compromised sites or download malware.
  
- **Benefits of DNS Filtering**:
  - **Protection Against Phishing**: Reduces the risk of accessing phishing sites that can steal user information.
  - **Block Malware**: Helps prevent devices from connecting to sites known to distribute malware.
  - **Control Content Access**: Enables network administrators to block access to inappropriate or undesirable websites, maintaining compliance with corporate policies or legal standards.
