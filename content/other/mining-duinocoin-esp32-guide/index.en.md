## Duino-Coin Mining on Raspberry Pi and X86-64 CPUs

### Mining on Raspberry Pi and X86-64 CPUs

While it is entirely possible to mine Duino-Coin on Raspberry Pi and X86-64 CPUs, it's essential to note that the rewards may not be as substantial compared to lower-powered devices. The Kolka system, prioritizing efficiency, makes mining on these devices less rewarding but still feasible.

#### Manual Setup Instructions
If you're interested in setting up Duino-Coin mining manually, you can follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin).

#### Docker Container Setup
Alternatively, for a quicker setup using Docker, a pre-configured container has been created. Follow the steps below to use the Docker container:

1. **Pull the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker pull simeononsecurity/duinocoin
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container with Custom Configuration:**
    ```bash
    docker run -td --name duco-container --restart unless-stopped \
      -e DUCO_USERNAME="your_actual_username_or_walletname" \
      -e DUCO_MINING_KEY="your_actual_mining_key" \
      -e DUCO_INTENSITY=50 \
      -e DUCO_THREADS=2 \
      -e DUCO_START_DIFF="MEDIUM" \
      -e DUCO_DONATE=1 \
      -e DUCO_IDENTIFIER="Auto" \
      -e DUCO_ALGORITHM="DUCO-S1" \
      -e DUCO_LANGUAGE="english" \
      -e DUCO_SOC_TIMEOUT=20 \
      -e DUCO_REPORT_SEC=300 \
      -e DUCO_RASPI_LEDS="n" \
      -e DUCO_RASPI_CPU_IOT="n" \
      -e DUCO_DISCORD_RP="n" \
      simeononsecurity/duinocoin
    ```

These options allow you to customize your Duino-Coin mining setup within the Docker container. Adjust the configuration parameters according to your preferences.

Mining on Raspberry Pi and X86-64 CPUs with Duino-Coin is a viable option, providing users with flexibility and ease of use in both manual and Docker container setups.

## Duino-Coin FAQ

### Q: Why favor low-powered devices?

**A:** The focus on low-powered devices stems from a commitment to eco-friendly mining practices. The intention is to create a system that is energy-efficient and does not contribute to excessive power consumption on a global scale.

### Q: Which Arduino board is the best for mining?

**A:** Most Arduinos (Uno, Pro Mini, Nano) utilizing the Atmega 328p chip offer similar performance (around 196 H/s - 10 DUCO/day). Boards with Atmega 16u2 (and similar) chips should also have comparable hashrates. Exceptions include Arduino DUE, Zero, and MKR, which, being ARM-based, have experimental support due to their distinct architecture.

### Q: An Arduino board makes more DUCO a day than a threadripper CPU?

**A:** Yes, the unique "Kolka system" implemented in Duino-Coin involves multiple security steps, reward multipliers, and factors favoring low-power devices. This ensures that earnings are more profitable for devices with lower power consumption, aligning with the coin's energy-efficient mining philosophy.

### Q: Why use SHA1?

**A:** SHA1 is chosen for its non-vectorizable cryptographic nature, making it easily implementable on various devices. The use of SHA1 in Duino-Coin ensures accessibility, and the Kolka system ensures that solving the DUCO-S1 job is consistently faster than brute-forcing the SHA1.

### Q: What about GPU mining?

**A:** GPU mining is possible (an official miner is in progress), but it proves less profitable than mining with lower-powered devices due to the non-vectorizable nature of DUCO-S1 and the high difficulty imposed by the Kolka system.

### Q: Is Duino-Coin a blockchain project?

**A:** Duino-Coin utilizes a hashchain, a variant of blockchain where blocks represent pure hashes. This interconnected system ensures the integrity of transactions and blocks, with publicly available blocks and transactions visible on the explorer.

### Q: From what is Duino-Coin forked from?

**A:** Duino-Coin is an entirely original project, not derived or forked from any existing codebase.

### Q: Why is everything so easily accessible and just pleasant to set up?

**A:** The emphasis on user-friendliness and accessibility stems from the creator's experience in the crypto world. The goal is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone, simplifying the setup process and making it enjoyable for a broader audience.

### Q: Can I create a mining farm with ESP boards or Arduinos?

**A:** While possible, the introduction of Kolka system V4 in 2020 has adjusted earnings to prevent excessive mining farm advantages. Earnings decrease progressively with the number of workers, striking a balance between small and large miners on the network.

### Q: Can I get rich by mining DUCO?

**A:** The potential for instant wealth through mining is unlikely. Duino-Coin encourages holding DUCO for potential value growth. If immediate returns are desired, consider converting mined DUCO to other cryptocurrencies based on exchange rates.

### Q: Is DUCO mining profitable?

**A:** Profitability depends on your goals. If you seek a fun and educational project within a supportive community while earning crypto, Duino-Coin mining is profitable. However, substantial profits are not expected, especially with powerful devices better suited for other cryptocurrencies.
