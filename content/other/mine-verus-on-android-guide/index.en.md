## Best Practices

- **Use a Lower Thread Count**: **Mining is CPU-intensive and generates heat**. To avoid damaging your device, **choose a lower number of threads**. Without active cooling **you should choose no more than 2 less than your max cores**. Monitor your device's temperature while mining.

- **Battery Impact**: Keep in mind that **mining can impact your battery life significantly**. Consider this when deciding to mine on your smartphone. For safety reasons this **could even mean removing the battery from your device** and **exclusively using usb power** to power the device.
