## Getting Started with Glotta

### Installation

To install Glotta, follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Open your command-line interface and navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to install Glotta via npm:

```shell
npm install glotta
```

### Environment Variables

To configure Glotta with the necessary environment variables, follow these steps:

1. **Google Translate API Configuration**
   - Create a service account in the Google Cloud Console and generate the JSON key file.
   - Place the JSON key file in your project directory, preferably in a folder named `gcloud-keys`.
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON key file. For example:

     ```
     GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcloud-keys/dev-service-account-keys.json
     ```

2. **Deepl Translate API Configuration**
   - If you choose to use the Deepl Translate API as the translation provider, obtain an authentication key from Deepl.
   - Set the `DEEPL_AUTH_KEY` environment variable to your Deepl authentication key. For example:

     ```
     DEEPL_AUTH_KEY=your-deepl-auth-key
     ```

3. **Translation Provider Configuration**
   - Glotta supports two translation providers: Google Translate and Deepl Translate.
   - To specify the desired translation provider, set the `TRANSLATE_PROVIDER` environment variable to either `GOOGLE` or `DEEPL`. For example:

     ```
     TRANSLATE_PROVIDER=GOOGLE
     ```

   - The default provider is `GOOGLE` if the `TRANSLATE_PROVIDER` variable is not set.

By configuring these environment variables, Glotta will seamlessly integrate with the specified translation provider, ensuring accurate and reliable translations for your Hugo content.

### Usage

Once Glotta is installed, you can use it to translate your Hugo markdown files. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open your command-line interface and navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the Glotta command with the desired options. For example:

```shell
npm run glotta --source=/your/hugo/content/directory --recursive --force
```

- `--source`: Specify the root directory to search for ".en.md" files. Replace `__fixtures__` with the desired directory name.
- `--recursive`: Include any nested directories in the root directory (default is false).
- `--force`: Overwrite existing language files if they exist (default is to ignore existing language files).
- `--targetLanguageIds`: Specify the target language IDs. By default, Glotta supports the following target IDs: ar, bn, ca, zh, fr, de, hi, it, ja, pt, pa, ro, ru, es.

3. Glotta will parse the input files, translate the content into the specified target languages, and write the translated files accordingly.

### Example Command Output

Here is an example of the output you might see when using Glotta:

```text
parsing input file...
translating text into... es
writing new file...
translating text into... ru
writing new file...
translating text into... ro
writing new file...

```

That's it! You are now ready to use Glotta for translating your Hugo markdown files and expanding the reach of your content to a global audience.

## Understanding Glotta's Core Concepts

**Chevrotain.js: The Foundation**
Glotta relies on the power of **Chevrotain.js**, a versatile library that enables developers to define lexers, parsers, and visitors. Chevrotain.js simplifies the process of handling complex grammars and facilitates efficient parsing and translation of content. Discover more about Chevrotain.js at [https://github.com/Chevrotain/chevrotain](https://github.com/Chevrotain/chevrotain).

**Lexer: Tokenizing Text**
The **lexer**, also known as a scanner, plays a crucial role in Glotta's translation process. It groups text characters into tokens, making it easier to analyze and manipulate the content accurately. By efficiently tokenizing the input text, Glotta ensures a seamless translation workflow.

**Regular Expressions (Regex): Applying Logic to Text**
**Regex patterns** provide developers with a powerful tool for applying logic to text based on specific patterns. Glotta leverages regex patterns to match and manipulate strings effectively during the translation process. Understanding regular expressions is beneficial for developers working with Glotta.

______

## Navigating Glotta's Translation Process

**Parser: Generating Syntax Trees**
Glotta employs a **parser** to generate syntax trees, such as concrete syntax trees or abstract syntax trees. These trees are constructed using grammar rules and tokens obtained from the lexer. By generating syntax trees, Glotta establishes a structured representation of the content, facilitating accurate translation.

**Visitor Pattern: Applying Logic to Syntax Trees**
The **visitor pattern** is instrumental in Glotta's translation workflow. It allows developers to apply logic to the data types within a syntax tree, enabling efficient traversal and manipulation of the translated content. By leveraging the visitor pattern, Glotta provides developers with greater control and customization options.
