### Compute Notable Mentions
Older Raspberry Pi models (1, 2, 3) should be sufficient. But newer models should be significantly more efficient and allow you do run multiple [low powered mining setups](https://simeononsecurity.com/other/creating-profitable-low-powered-crypto-miners/) on a single device. This is why we recommend newer compute hardware.

## Recommended GPS Receivers DIY RTKDirect Deployments
There are many receivers on the market but at a bare minimum it must support [**RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTCM_SC-104) and ideally have the ability to be hooked up to an antenna outside of the install location with 360 degree unobstructed view of the sky.

These are all going to be devices that are Triple-Band, High Pull Rate, Extreme Position Receivers. Most won't support USB. They will require PCI-E, UART, I2C, or Serial Connections. THey will allow you to be capable of at most of the RTKDirect rewards. While you'll be able to use the same software we mention below, the instructions we've provided may not exactly line up. Be advised that things like COM ports and the dongle specific instructions may be different for you.

## Recommended Antenna Splitters

When choosing antenna splitters for your setup, it's crucial to avoid options that may harm your radios, such as the one linked [here](https://amzn.to/3QryASQ). This type of splitter can potentially damage your equipment.

Instead, consider opting for antenna splitters that intelligently split the signal without affecting the DC power. 

Here are two recommended options:

| Model                                                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                      |

### Linux - Docker Container 

#### 1. Install Docker

Consult the following guides for more information on how to install docker

- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

#### 2. Run the Docker Container

  Run our [Docker container](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/docker-rtklib-onocoy-rtkdirect), ensuring that you provide the necessary environment variables and parameters:

    > You don't have to specify both Onocoy and RTKDirect credentials. The backend script is smart and looks to see if they have been set. You can use one or both and this should function perfectly.

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -td \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     --name sosrtk \
     --device=/dev/<YOUR_USB_PORT> \
     -e USB_PORT=<YOUR_USB_PORT> \
     -e BAUD_RATE=<YOUR_SERIAL_BAUD_RATE> \
     -e DATA_BITS=<YOUR_SERIAL_DATA_BITS> \
     -e PARITY=<YOUR_SERIAL_PARITY> \
     -e STOP_BITS=<YOUR_SERIAL_STOP_BITS> \
     -e ONOCOY_USERNAME=<YOUR_ONOCOY_MOUNTPOINT_USERNAME> \
     -e PASSWORD=<YOUR_ONOCOY_MOUNTPOINT_PASSWORD> \
     -e PORT_NUMBER=<YOUR_RTKLIB_PORT_NUMBER> \
     -e LAT=<OPTIONAL_YOUR_LATITUDE> \
     -e LONG=<OPTIONAL_YOUR_LONGITUDE> \
     -e ELEVATION=<OPTIONAL_YOUR_ELEVATION_FROM_SEA_LEVEL_IN_METERS> \
     -e INSTRUMENT=<OPTIONAL_YOUR_GPS_RECEIVER_DESCRIPTION> \
     -e ANTENNA=<OPTIONAL_YOUR_ANTENNA_DESCRIPTION> \
     simeononsecurity/docker-rtklib-onocoy-rtkdirect:latest
   ```

   Ensure you replace the placeholder values (`<...>`) with your specific configuration.

   Ex.
   ```bash
   docker run \
    -td \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --name sosrtk \
    --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 \
    -e USB_PORT=ttyUSB0 \
    -e BAUD_RATE=921600 \
    -e DATA_BITS=8 \
    -e PARITY=n \
    -e STOP_BITS=1 \
    -e ONOCOY_USERNAME=your_onocoy_mountpoint_username \
    -e PASSWORD=your_onocoy_mountpoint_password \
    -e PORT_NUMBER=32377 \
    -e LAT=37.7749 \
    -e LONG=-122.4194 \
    -e ELEVATION=50 \
    -e INSTRUMENT="Your GPS Receiver" \
    -e ANTENNA="Your Antenna" \
    simeononsecurity/docker-rtklib-onocoy-rtkdirect:latest
   ```


### Linux - Manually


#### 1. Install RTKBase

```bash
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefal/rtkbase/master/tools/install.sh -O install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh --all release #must not be run as root
#RTKbase comes with a web element that doesn't work for our purposes.
sudo systemctl disable rtkbase_web 
sudo systemctl stop rtkbase_web
```
or if you're on Ubuntu specifically

```bash
sudo apt install -y rtklib
```

#### 2. Set up STR2STR

1. **Test Set up USB to local TCP server**
  > **Note:** When setting up USB to a local TCP server using the `str2str` command, ensure you specify your serial settings correctly. In the provided example:

  ```bash
  str2str -in serial://ttyUSB0:921600:8:n:1#rtcm3 -out tcpsvr://:5015 -b 1 -t 0
  ```
   - **ttyUSB0**: Specifies the USB port. Adjust this based on your system configuration.
   - **921600**: Represents the baud rate. Modify this value if your device requires a different baud rate. Another common baud rate for GPS receivers is `115200`.
   - **8**: Indicates the data bits.
   - **n**: Represents no parity.
   - **1**: Indicates one stop bit.

  Make sure to customize these settings according to your specific hardware and communication requirements.

  > *For those who aren't following my guide exactly and are using a standalone NTRIP device, like the NTRIP-X or Ardusimple Devices with the Wifi Master, or have followed our ESP32 guide, you'll end up doing something like the following `str2str -in ntrip://your-ntrip-source-here#rtcm3 -out tcpsvr://:5015#rtcm3`  in combination with a service like [Emlid Caster](https://emlid.com/ntrip-caster/). Play around with the `--help`. You goal should be to take NTRIP in and do local TCP out. Unfortunately the two software packages available for Linux don't let you take in NTRIP in as a caster directly, so we have to go through a middle man and access it as a NTRIP client.*


2. **Test Set Up TCP Forwarding to RTKDirect**

  You'll need the IP and portnumber from the [RTKDirect Console](https://cloud.rtkdirect.com/hotspots).

  ```bash
  str2str -in tcpcli://localhost:5015#rtcm3 -out tcpcli://ntrip.rtkdirect.com:portnumber#rtcm3 -msg "1006(30), 1008(30), 1012(30), 1033(30), 1077, 1087, 1097, 1107, 1117, 1127, 1137, 1230" -p lat long elevation(m) -i "SimeonOnSecurity UM980 RTKLIB DIY" -a "GEODNET ANTENNA" -t 0
  ```

   **Notes**: 

  - Be sure to replace the message numbers if you know you don't use [MSMv7 RTCM3 messages](https://www.use-snip.com/kb/knowledge-base/rtcm-3-message-list/). Otherwise, don't touch them.
  - Be sure to replace the values for -p, -i, and -a with your, geo cords, receiver model and your antenna if applicable. If you don't know them, omit this information from the command.
   - Elevation relative to sea level in meters. 
   - Use tools like [gps-coordinates.net](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/) to get your coordinates and [FreeMapTools](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm) to get your elevation.
   - Under `-out` be sure to specify the port number the dashboard gives you.
     - The IP provided in the dashboard, at least for now, is the same as `ntrip.rtkdirect.com`. They point to the same space.

1. **Test Set Up NTRIPv1 for Onocoy**

  You'll need the Mountpoint Username and Password from the [Onocoy Console](https://console.onocoy.com/)

  ```bash
  str2str -in tcpcli://localhost:5015#rtcm3 -out ntrips://:password@servers.onocoy.com:2101/username#rtcm3 -msg "1006(30), 1033(30), 1077, 1087, 1097, 1117, 1127, 1137, 1230" -p lat long elevation(m) -i "SimeonOnSecurity UM980 RTKLIB DIY" -a "GEODNET ANTENNA" -t 0
  ```

  **Notes**: 
  
  - Be sure to replace the message numbers if you know you don't use [MSMv7 RTCM3 messages](https://www.use-snip.com/kb/knowledge-base/rtcm-3-message-list/). Otherwise, don't touch them.

  - Be sure to replace the values for -p, -i, and -a with your, geo cords, receiver model and your antenna if applicable. If you don't know them, omit this information from the command.
   - Elevation relative to sea level in meters. 
   - Use tools like [gps-coordinates.net](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/) to get your coordinates and [FreeMapTools](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm) to get your elevation.
   - Under `-out` be sure to specify the password and username number the onocoy console gives you.

1. **Set Up STR2STR SYSTMCTL Services**

  To make sure that it starts up on boot, we need to create a service.

### Windows

Please see the [Windows instructions for Onocoy instructions](https://simeononsecurity.com/other/onocoy-gps-gnss-reciever-basestation-on-a-budget/#windows-option-1-strsvr), use `STR2SRV` to output to one **NTRIPServer for onocoy** and one **tcpclient for RTKDirect**.

#### Bonus: Quadruple Mining with FrysCrypto (Windows Required)

> ***Note: We do not recommend doing anything with FrysCrypto. Don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose.***

> **Note:** This section is not tested as far as we'd normally like. We had a few readers suggest this configuration. Your milage may very. We'll update this as we learn more and improve on it.

This part gets a bit complicated. You'll likely need to install your UM980 using the Linux instructions. Then, you'll need to run the following instructions on Windows.

1. First download and install the [Outdoor Sattlite Miner Alpha Download](https://www.fryfoundation.com/outdoor-satellite-miner-download) from the FryFoundation Website. This will install python, a python script, a batch script, and [U-Blox's U-Center 2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/u-center-2). 
   1. When you're setting it up, it'll ask for your algorand wallet's private key, please make sure you create a [dedicated algorand wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/) for this purpose. **Do not use your existing wallet.**
2. Download and install [`hup4com`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/files/hub4com/2.1.0.0/hub4com-2.1.0.0-386.zip/download) and [`com0com`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) from the [Null-modem Emulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) project.
   1. Use all the default options and hit next until the last page, then click "Open Setup" and next one last time. 
      1. Remove all non COM devices.
      2. Take note of the preconfigured COM device names. We got `COM4` and `COM5`
   2.  Extract the zip files and place it in a safe and well known location. For our example we will be using `C:\temp\hub4com\`
       1.  Open up a terminal in the folder above and run `.\multiplexer.bat --link-type tcp xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5015 COMX`
4. Open [U-Blox's U-Center 2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/u-center-2) and on the second tab you'll see an option to "Add Device". Click "Add Device" and select the com port you created during the com0com setup.
4. Lastly, don't forget to register your [BYOD Outdoor Satellite Miner](https://www.fryfoundation.com/byod-outdoor-satellite-registration)
