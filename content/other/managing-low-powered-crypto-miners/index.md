# Managing a Fleet of Low-Powered Miners
Are you interested in building a fleet of low-powered miners to generate passive income? If so, you might be wondering how to manage multiple remote nodes effectively. In this article, we will explore some of the best practices for managing a fleet of low-powered miners and discuss services that can help you maintain access to nodes without the need for direct port forwarding.

## Introduction
In our previous article, "Build a Profitable Passive Income Box with Low-Powered Hardware: A Guide," we explored how to build a low-powered miner and set it up to generate passive income. However, if you're looking to scale up and manage multiple miners, you'll need a way to manage them effectively.

One of the challenges of managing remote nodes is maintaining access to them. If you're using a traditional port forwarding setup, you'll need to have the right hardware, configure the router, and ensure that you're able to maintain access to the nodes over time. This can be a time-consuming and challenging process, particularly if you're managing multiple nodes.

## Remote.it and ngrok
Thankfully, there are services that can help you manage remote nodes more effectively. One such service is remote.it, which allows you to establish secure, remote connections to your nodes without port forwarding. With [remote.it](https://www.remote.it/), you can connect to your nodes over the internet, even if they're behind a firewall or NAT. This can help you manage your nodes more effectively and reduce the time and effort required to maintain access to them.

Another service that can help you manage remote nodes is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Ngrok is a secure tunneling service that allows you to expose a local web server to the internet. With ngrok, you can create a secure connection to your nodes and manage them remotely without the need for port forwarding. This can be particularly useful if you're managing nodes that are behind a firewall or NAT.

## OpenVPN and WireGuard
In addition to services like remote.it and ngrok, you can also use VPNs like [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) to manage your nodes remotely. Both OpenVPN and WireGuard have options for reverse VPNs, which allow you to connect to a remote network from a node on that network. This is different than a traditional vpn where you're connecting from the miner to a vpn. Instead we're connecting the miner to the vpn and then port forwarding through the vpn. If we connect to the same vpn we can then ssh and remote into the miner through the internal vpn connection's ip for the miner. This can be a useful way to manage remote nodes, particularly if you have a dedicated VPN connection as a back channel to access them remotely. . 

## Certificate Authentication and Fail2ban
When managing remote nodes, especially if they are exposed to the internet, it's important to ensure that they are secure and protected against unauthorized access. One way to do this is to use certificate authentication to authenticate connections to the nodes. Certificate authentication is a more secure alternative to traditional password authentication, as it requires a digital certificate to verify the identity of the connecting device.

In addition to certificate authentication, it's also important to have [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) installed on your nodes. Fail2ban is a tool that can detect and prevent brute force attacks on your nodes by blocking IP addresses that attempt to connect unsuccessfully. By having fail2ban installed, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your nodes and ensure that they remain secure.

## Snort
Another tool that can help you manage your nodes effectively is [Snort](https://www.snort.org/). Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system that can help you detect and prevent threats going into and out of your nodes. By having Snort installed on your nodes, you can be alerted to any suspicious activity and take steps to mitigate potential threats. This can help you keep your nodes secure and prevent any damage to your system.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, managing a fleet of low-powered miners can be a challenge, particularly when it comes to maintaining access to remote nodes. However, by using services like remote.it and ngrok, as well as VPNs like OpenVPN and WireGuard, you can.
