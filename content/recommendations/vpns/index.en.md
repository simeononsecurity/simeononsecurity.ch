If you value your privacy and want to stay secure online, a virtual private network (VPN) is an essential tool. By encrypting your internet connection and masking your IP address, a VPN makes it much more difficult for hackers, governments, and advertisers to track your online activity and steal your personal information. 

But with so many VPN providers out there, it can be tough to know which one to choose. That's why SimeonOnSecurity has put together a list of **recommended VPN providers** that prioritize security, privacy, and ease of use. 

## Mullvad VPN

[Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en/) is a popular VPN provider that's known for its strong commitment to privacy. It uses **end-to-end encryption** to protect your data, doesn't keep any logs of your online activity, and even allows you to sign up for the service anonymously by using cash or cryptocurrency. 

Mullvad is also extremely user-friendly, with a simple interface that's easy to navigate even for VPN novices. And with servers in more than 30 countries, you can use Mullvad to unblock geo-restricted content from all over the world. 

## ProtonVPN

[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is another highly rated VPN provider that takes your privacy seriously. It was created by the same team behind the popular encrypted email service ProtonMail, and it offers similar levels of security and privacy. 

ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland, which has some of the strongest privacy laws in the world. The company doesn't keep any logs of your online activity, and it offers features like **Secure Core** (which routes your traffic through multiple servers for added security) and **Perfect Forward Secrecy** (which generates a new encryption key for each session to prevent future decryption of past sessions). 

Like Mullvad, ProtonVPN is also very user-friendly, with apps for all major platforms and servers in dozens of countries. And if you're not ready to commit to a paid subscription, you can try out ProtonVPN for free with its basic plan.
