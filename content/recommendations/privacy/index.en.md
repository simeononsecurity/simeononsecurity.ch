Privacy is a fundamental right that is essential for democracy, liberty, and freedom of speech. However, with governments, corporations, and cybercriminals abusing our privacy, it is becoming increasingly challenging to keep our personal data secure. To help safeguard your privacy rights, we've compiled a list of recommended privacy resources that cover identity theft protection, digital security, privacy rights, and more. 

### Why Does Privacy Matter?

Before we dive into the recommended resources, let's briefly discuss why privacy matters. Our privacy is being abused by governments with mass-surveillance, corporations profiting from selling personal data, and cybercriminals stealing poorly-secured personal data and using it against us. Hence, security is needed to keep our private data private, and good digital security is critical to stay protected from the growing risks associated with the war on data.

### Privacy Rights

To learn more about your privacy rights, check out [PrivacyRights.org - Resources](https://privacyrights.org/resources). The website provides information on privacy laws, identity theft, data breaches, and more. By knowing your rights, you can take action to protect your personal information and safeguard your privacy.

### Family, Children, and Teens

Protecting your family's privacy is just as crucial as protecting your own. To that end, [FTC - Protecting Kids Online](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/protecting-kids-online) provides resources for teaching your children about digital security, while [NetSmartz - Resources](https://www.missingkids.org/netsmartz/resources) offers resources for protecting your family online.

### Identity Theft Protection and Assistance

Identity theft is one of the most significant privacy risks, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Start by getting your free annual credit report from the three major credit agencies at [Free Credit Report](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action). You can also learn how to freeze your credit with the major and minor credit agencies at [IntelTechniques.com - Credit Freeze Guide](https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf).

### Digital Security and Hygiene

Good digital security and hygiene practices are critical for protecting your privacy. Some resources to help you stay secure include [Michael Horowitz - Defensive Computing Checklist](https://defensivecomputingchecklist.com/), which covers how to be generally secure and become aware of active threats, and [IntelTechniques.com - Personal Data Removal Workbook](https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf), which teaches you how to remove your information from many databrokers. For a comprehensive guide to personal security, digital security, and digital hygiene, check out [Lissy93 - personal-security-checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist).

### File Complaints and Report Fraud

If you suspect that your privacy has been violated, it is crucial to report the incident. You can report a missing, abused, or sexually exploited child at [Report a Missing, Abused or Sexually Exploited Child](http://www.missingkids.com/Report). For cyber-related complaints such as identity theft, spam, online scams, and more, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at [File a cyber-related complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1). You can also file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at [File a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](https://complaint.ic3.gov/default.aspx?) for cyber crimes, hacks, digital theft, and more.
