In today's digital age, protecting our personal information and online security has become more important than ever. Data breaches, identity theft, and other cyber threats are all too common, and the consequences can be devastating. That's why it's crucial to take steps to safeguard your privacy online. In this article, we'll explore some of the recommended privacy services available to help you protect your personal data and online security.

## Privacy Services

The first category of privacy services we'll cover is services that help you remove your personal information from data brokers. These are companies that collect and sell personal information, often without our knowledge or consent. Removing your information from these data brokers can help reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of identity theft.

The **preferred** service in this category is [Abine DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/refer?coupon=RFR-40867-7DWHR4). This service has been in business since 2010 and is trusted by over 20,000 customers. DeleteMe offers several subscription options, starting at $129 per year, and will remove your personal information from up to 25 data brokers.

Another **alternate** service to consider in this category is [OneRep](https://onerep.com). [OneRep](https://simeononsecurity.com/articles/onerep-data-removal-privacy-service/) offers a similar service to DeleteMe, removing your personal information from data brokers. OneRep's pricing is more affordable than DeleteMe, starting at $4.95 per month, but they do not remove information from as many data brokers as DeleteMe.

A new addition to this category is [Optery](https://app.optery.com/). Optery is a comprehensive privacy service that helps you manage and protect your personal information online. With Optery, you can easily remove your information from data brokers, control your online presence, and safeguard your privacy. Although specific pricing details may vary, Optery offers competitive subscription options tailored to meet your privacy needs. We really like the screenshots and direct links to each data exposure. This information can make tracking your exposures significantly easier.

## Masking Information

The next category of services we'll cover is information masking. These services help protect your personal information by masking it, making it harder for it to be stolen or used maliciously. The services we'll cover in this category are password managers and one-time-use debit cards.

The **preferred** service in this category is [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/join/SU86Y). Privacy.com offers a free and easy way to generate one-time-use debit cards. This means that you can use a different debit card number for every online transaction, reducing the risk of your card being compromised. In addition to one-time-use debit cards, Privacy.com also offers virtual cards and bank accounts, making it a versatile and comprehensive option for online privacy.

Another **alternate** service to consider in this category is [Abine Blur](https://dnt.abine.com/#/ref_register/pC8ZbvQtt). Blur is a password manager that offers identity masking and one-time-use debit cards. This service is similar to Privacy.com, but offers more features, including password management and masked email addresses. However, Blur's pricing is higher than Privacy.com, starting at $39 per year.

## Online Password Managers

The final category of services we'll cover is online password managers. Password managers help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts. This is crucial for online security, as weak passwords are one of the most common ways that hackers gain access to accounts.

The **preferred** service in this category is [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com). Bitwarden is a free, open-source, and end-to-end encrypted password manager. This means that your passwords are always protected and never accessible to anyone except you. Bitwarden is available on multiple platforms, making it easy to use and access your passwords from anywhere. The service also offers a premium plan, starting at $10 per year, which adds advanced features like password health reports and two-factor authentication.

Another **alternate** service to consider in this category is [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/). LastPass is one of the most popular password managers available, with over 25 million users. Like Bitwarden, LastPass offers a free and premium version, with the premium version starting at $3 per month. LastPass offers a range of features, including password sharing and emergency access, making it a comprehensive option for online security.
