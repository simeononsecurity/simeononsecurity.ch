Are you concerned about your online privacy and security? With the increasing number of data breaches and online tracking, it's more important than ever to protect yourself while browsing the web. In this article, we'll explore [SimeonOnSecurity's](https://twitter.com/SimeonOnSecurity) recommended browser plugins that can help enhance your online privacy and security.

## Recommended Browsers

Firstly, it's important to choose a browser that prioritizes privacy and security. [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is the recommended daily-driver browser, but for enhanced privacy and security, you may also consider using the [**TOR Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/). However, it's important not to install any plugins in the TOR browser, as it can compromise your anonymity and security.

## Recommended Plugins

1. [**U-Block Origin**](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - This is an open-source ad blocker that is highly effective at blocking ads, pop-ups, and other unwanted content. It also improves page load times and reduces data usage.

2. [**HTTPS Everywhere**](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - This plugin automatically redirects you to the HTTPS version of a website when available, which is more secure than the unencrypted HTTP version.

3. [**Decentraleyes**](https://decentraleyes.org/) - This plugin emulates the content delivery network (CDN) locally, preventing tracking of your browsing activity by third-party CDN providers.

4. [**ClearURLs**](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) - This plugin removes tracking tags and parameters from URLs, improving your online privacy and reducing tracking by ad networks and other third-party services.

5. [**CanvasBlocker**](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker) - This plugin prevents websites from creating a unique "fingerprint" of your browser based on your device and settings, enhancing your online privacy.

6. [**Multi Account Containers**](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers) - This plugin allows you to create isolated browsing sessions for different websites, preventing them from tracking your online activity across different sites.

7. [**Terms of Service, Didn't Read**](https://tosdr.org/downloads.html) - This plugin summarizes the most important parts of website terms of service agreements, so you can quickly and easily understand what you're agreeing to when using a site.

8. [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/) - This is a secure and open-source password manager that lets you store all of your passwords in one place and generate strong, unique passwords for each site you use.

9. [**Privacy Badger**](https://privacybadger.org/) - This plugin learns which trackers are used by websites and blocks them, improving your online privacy and reducing tracking by advertisers and other third-party services.

These plugins can help enhance your online privacy and security while browsing the web. It's important to note that while Firefox is the recommended daily-driver browser, for enhanced privacy and security, you may also consider using the TOR Browser. However, it's important not to install any plugins in the TOR browser, as it can compromise your anonymity and security. By using these recommended browser plugins, you can browse the web with more peace of mind, knowing that you're taking steps to protect your online privacy and security.
