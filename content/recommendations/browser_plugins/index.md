**Note:** The only daily-driver browser I recommend is FireFox. 
Alternatively you should be using the TOR Browser. Do not install plugins in the TOR browser.

1. [U-Block Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - **Prefered** - A great Open-Source AD blocker.
2. [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - **Prefered** - Forces your browser to load sites over HTTPS rather than HTTP
3. [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/) - Local CDN Emulator
4. [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) - Dynamically removes tracking tags from links
5. [CanvasBlocker](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker) - Prevents JavaScript Fingerprinting
6. [Multi Account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers) - Allows for isolated brower sessions
7. [Terms of Service, Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org/downloads.html) - Informs user of shady ToS
8. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - Secure Open-Source Cloud Password Manager
9. [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) - Learns and blocks trackers
