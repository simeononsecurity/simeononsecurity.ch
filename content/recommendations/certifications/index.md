description: "SimeonOnSecurity's Recommended Certifications"
---
There are many Cyber and IT related certifications out there, but most are argueably a waste of time over others. Some will enable you to land a job, while others wont. This list consists of the certifications that SimeonOnSecurity recommends for those seeking to enter the IT and CyberSecurity job force.

**Notes:**
- This should apply everywhere in the US, but outside the US these are likely to change.
- There may be other certs out there that are worth in a specific category that aren't listed here, but the ones here are listed over others because they have the widest recognition. 
- While the certifications listed here are a mix of Networking, Windows, Linux, Hacking, and Management certifications, all of these are directly related to positions in Cyber and will greatly benefit you to have them.

## Certifications:
### Entry Level:
**Note:** These certifications are for entry-level professionals. They are the baseline of a good IT/Cyber skill set. You should be very familiar with all the information required to get these certs at every level.

- [CompTIA's Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)
- [CompTIA's Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)
### Associate Level:
**Note:** Typically, you only need one of these certifications. Multiple are still useful and valueable.

## Notable Mentions:
- [eLearnSecurity Certifications](https://elearnsecurity.com/) - Cost effective if you're going for multiple certifications at once. But, eLearnSecurity is pretty new and the certifications aren't really recongnised yet.
- [Hurricane Electric IPv6 Sage](https://ipv6.he.net/certification/) - Free certification, somewhat easy, good resume filler. 
- [Python Institute's PCEP/PCAP/PCPP](https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/) - Good to have, but isn't gonna get you a job by itself. Offers free training for the first two certifications.
- [Splunk Certifications](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training.html) - You're better off learning the material and skipping the certifications.
- [W3 Schools Python/SQL/PHP/JAVA](https://www.w3schools.com/CERT/default.asp) - Good to have, but isn't gonna get you a job by itself. 
- [Wireshark's WCNA](https://www.wcnacertification.com/) - Good to have, but isn't gonna get you a job by itself.
