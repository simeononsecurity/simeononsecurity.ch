**FISMA 101: An Overview of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act**

## [Home](/cyber-security-career-playbook-start/)

## Introduction

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) is a US law enacted in 2002 that requires federal agencies to establish and maintain information security programs to protect their information and information systems. This act was passed in response to the growing need for improved information security in the federal government, and it has since been updated several times to keep pace with the changing threat landscape.

## What is FISMA?

FISMA is a set of standards and guidelines for information security that apply to federal agencies and their contractors. The purpose of FISMA is to ensure that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. FISMA requires that federal agencies implement a risk-based approach to information security, which involves identifying and assessing potential security risks, implementing security controls to mitigate those risks, and continuously monitoring the effectiveness of those controls.

## Key Components of FISMA

There are several key components of FISMA, including:

- **Risk Management**: Federal agencies must conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security risks and implement security controls to mitigate those risks.

- **Security Control Assessment**: Federal agencies must assess the effectiveness of their security controls to ensure they are working as intended and to identify any areas that need improvement.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Federal agencies must continuously monitor their information systems to ensure they are secure and to respond to any security incidents that occur.

- **Incident Response**: Federal agencies must have a plan in place for responding to security incidents and must be able to quickly identify, contain, and resolve security incidents.

- **Authorization and Accreditation**: Federal agencies must obtain authorization from the appropriate authority to operate their information systems, and must regularly assess and re-accredit those systems to ensure they are secure.

### Risk Management

FISMA requires federal agencies to conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security risks and implement security controls to mitigate those risks. The risk management process involves the following steps:

1. **Identification of assets**: Federal agencies must first identify the assets they need to protect, including sensitive information and information systems.

2. **Threat and vulnerability assessment**: Federal agencies must then assess the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact their assets and determine the likelihood and impact of those threats.

3. **Risk determination**: Based on the results of the threat and vulnerability assessment, federal agencies must determine the level of risk to their assets and prioritize the risks that need to be addressed first.

4. **Mitigation planning**: Federal agencies must then develop a plan to mitigate the identified risks, including the implementation of security controls such as access controls, encryption, and firewalls.

5. **Implementation**: Federal agencies must then implement the security controls they have identified as necessary to mitigate the risks to their assets.

6. **Monitoring and assessment**: Federal agencies must continuously monitor their information systems to ensure that the security controls are working as intended and to identify any areas that need improvement.

### Security Control Assessment

Federal agencies must assess the effectiveness of their security controls to ensure they are working as intended and to identify any areas that need improvement. This involves the following steps:

1. **Testing**: Federal agencies must test their security controls to ensure they are working correctly and to identify any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

2. **Evaluation**: Federal agencies must evaluate the results of the testing to determine the effectiveness of the security controls and identify any areas that need improvement.

3. **Remediation**: Based on the results of the evaluation, federal agencies must develop a plan to address any vulnerabilities or areas for improvement and implement the necessary remediation actions.

4. **Continuous improvement**: Federal agencies must continuously monitor and assess the effectiveness of their security controls and make improvements as necessary to ensure they are providing adequate protection for their assets.

### Continuous Monitoring

Federal agencies must continuously monitor their information systems to ensure they are secure and to respond to any security incidents that occur. This includes the following steps:

1. **Real-time monitoring**: Federal agencies must use real-time monitoring tools to detect and respond to security incidents as they occur.

2. **Log analysis**: Federal agencies must regularly review logs from their information systems to detect any unusual or suspicious activity and respond to security incidents.

3. **Vulnerability scanning**: Federal agencies must conduct regular vulnerability scans of their information systems to identify any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

4. **Incident response**: Federal agencies must have a plan in place for responding to security incidents and must be able to quickly identify, contain, and resolve security incidents.

### Authorization and Accreditation

Federal agencies must obtain authorization from the appropriate authority to operate their information systems, and must regularly assess and re-accredit those systems to ensure they are secure. This involves the following steps:

1. **System authorization**: Federal agencies must obtain authorization from the appropriate authority to operate their information systems.

2. **Security assessment**: Federal agencies must conduct a security assessment of their information systems to identify any security risks and vulnerabilities.

3. **Mitigation planning**: Based on the results of the security assessment, federal agencies must develop a plan to mitigate any security risks and vulnerabilities and implement the necessary security controls.

4. **Accreditation**: Federal agencies must then obtain accreditation from the appropriate authority to ensure that their information systems meet the necessary security standards and are authorized to operate.

5. **Re-accreditation**: Federal agencies must regularly assess and re-accredit their information systems to ensure that they continue to meet the necessary security standards and to identify any areas for improvement.

## Benefits of FISMA

There are several benefits of FISMA, including:

### Improved Information Security

One of the primary benefits of FISMA is improved information security for federal agencies. By requiring federal agencies to establish and maintain strong information security programs, FISMA helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Additionally, FISMA requires federal agencies to conduct regular risk assessments, security control assessments, and continuous monitoring, which helps ensure that their information systems remain secure over time.

### Better Risk Management

FISMA also helps federal agencies better manage security risks by requiring them to conduct regular risk assessments and implement security controls to mitigate those risks. This helps federal agencies identify and prioritize security risks and make informed decisions about how to best mitigate those risks. Additionally, FISMA requires federal agencies to continuously monitor their information systems, which helps ensure that security risks are detected and addressed in a timely manner.

### Increased Transparency

FISMA requires federal agencies to report on their information security programs, which helps increase transparency and accountability. This allows stakeholders, such as Congress, to see how federal agencies are managing information security risks and to hold them accountable for any security incidents that occur.

### Strengthened Collaboration

FISMA also helps strengthen collaboration and coordination among federal agencies and their contractors and other stakeholders by requiring them to follow the same information security standards. This helps ensure that everyone is working together to protect sensitive information and that information security risks are managed effectively across all levels of the federal government.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, FISMA is a critical component of information security in the US federal government. By requiring federal agencies to establish and maintain information security programs, FISMA helps ensure that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. By requiring regular risk assessments, continuous monitoring, and incident response, FISMA helps federal agencies manage security risks and respond quickly to security incidents. Overall, FISMA is an important tool for improving information security in the federal government and protecting sensitive information.
