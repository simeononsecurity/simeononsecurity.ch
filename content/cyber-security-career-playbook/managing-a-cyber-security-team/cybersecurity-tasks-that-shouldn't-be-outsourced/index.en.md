## All Cybersecurity Tasks That Must Be Kept In-House

### Introduction

In today's digital landscape, **cybersecurity threats are on the rise**, with a significant increase of 600% since the pandemic[^1^]. As a result, businesses are faced with the challenge of protecting their assets against these evolving and sophisticated threats. While many companies opt to outsource their cybersecurity operations to managed security service providers (MSSPs), there are certain tasks that are better kept in-house. In this article, we will explore the **cybersecurity tasks that should be retained within an organization**, highlighting their importance and benefits.

## Control and Governance

One of the primary reasons to keep cybersecurity tasks in-house is the need for **control and governance**. By having an internal cybersecurity team, business leaders can have a greater level of operational control over their security infrastructure. They can carefully select and monitor the cybersecurity professionals working within the organization, ensuring they align with the company's culture and values. This level of control also enables effective communication of confidential business measures to the in-house teams, fostering a stronger security environment.

For example, in industries with strict regulatory requirements such as finance or healthcare, organizations need to adhere to specific security standards and guidelines. By keeping cybersecurity tasks in-house, companies can directly manage and enforce compliance with these regulations, minimizing the risk of non-compliance and potential penalties. Furthermore, having control over security operations allows organizations to quickly respond to emerging threats and tailor their cybersecurity strategies to address specific vulnerabilities or industry-specific risks.

## Security and Privacy of Confidential Data

The **security and privacy of confidential customer data** are critical concerns for any organization. Several instances have highlighted the risks associated with third-party information security providers mishandling sensitive information. For instance, the 2019 controversy surrounding Apple revealed that a contractor overseeing quality control had access to private user recordings. To mitigate such risks, keeping certain cybersecurity tasks internal ensures that sensitive information remains within the organization's boundaries, reducing the likelihood of data breaches and unauthorized access.

By managing cybersecurity tasks in-house, organizations can implement robust security measures tailored to their specific needs and the sensitivity of the data they handle. They can establish stringent access controls, encryption protocols, and data protection mechanisms to safeguard customer information. Additionally, internal cybersecurity teams can continuously monitor and audit data handling processes to detect and address any potential vulnerabilities or insider threats. This proactive approach to data security helps build trust with customers and protects the organization's reputation.

## Comprehensive Understanding of the Business

In-house cybersecurity teams possess a **comprehensive understanding of the business**, including its day-to-day activities, network infrastructure, and roles of various team members. This knowledge enables them to have a deeper awareness of the potential impact of technical changes on servers, networks, individuals, teams, and the overall business. This understanding allows for better decision-making and implementation of cybersecurity measures that align with the organization's specific needs and goals.

For example, let's consider a software development company. The in-house cybersecurity team is familiar with the company's software development lifecycle, including the tools, frameworks, and programming languages used. This understanding allows them to identify potential vulnerabilities or security gaps in the development process and implement appropriate security controls. They can collaborate with developers, providing guidance on secure coding practices, performing code reviews, and integrating security testing into the development pipeline. This comprehensive understanding of the business empowers the cybersecurity team to effectively protect the organization's software assets.

## Improved Communication and Collaboration Among Teams

Outsourcing cybersecurity operations can lead to challenges in terms of **response time and communication**. Managed security service providers often handle multiple clients, which may result in slower response times, especially when dealing with cyber-attacks. On the other hand, in-house cybersecurity teams are fully committed to the organization and can collaborate easily with other employees. This enables quicker threat detection, immediate incident response, and reduced service downtimes. The improved communication and collaboration among teams also facilitate a more proactive and effective approach to cybersecurity.

For instance, imagine a financial institution that experiences a potential security incident involving suspicious account activity. With an in-house cybersecurity team, they can directly communicate with the IT operations team, customer support, and relevant stakeholders to assess the situation, gather necessary information, and take immediate actions to mitigate the risks. The seamless collaboration and real-time communication enable a swift response, minimizing the impact on customers and the overall business operations.

## Merging Cybersecurity and Physical Security

An advantage of having an in-house security team is the ability to merge **cybersecurity and physical security** measures. By combining existing physical security systems such as swipe cards, surveillance, and access control with cybersecurity operations, organizations can establish a Joint Security Operations Center (JSOC). This integrated approach provides a holistic view of events, enabling deeper investigation into cyber-attacks, data breaches, and insider threats. It also helps identify unusual patterns and potential vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed when security functions are siloed.

For example, consider a large corporate campus with multiple buildings and access points. By integrating cybersecurity measures with physical security systems, the in-house security team can monitor and analyze data from various sources, such as access logs, video surveillance, and intrusion detection systems. This comprehensive approach allows them to identify any potential correlation between physical security incidents, such as unauthorized access to restricted areas, and cybersecurity events, such as network breaches or compromised accounts. The ability to merge these two domains strengthens the organization's overall security posture and enhances threat detection capabilities.

## Priority Attention and Quality Maintenance

Having an in-house cybersecurity team ensures that the organization's **security needs receive priority attention**. The dedicated team members are focused solely on the company's security, ensuring a prompt response to any issues or incidents that arise. This level of attention leads to higher-quality maintenance and a stronger security architecture overall. In contrast, outsourcing security operations may result in delays or a lack of immediate action due to the limitations of service level agreements or the involvement of multiple clients.

For instance, imagine a critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used software application that the organization relies on. With an in-house cybersecurity team, they can quickly assess the impact, prioritize remediation efforts, and coordinate with the necessary stakeholders to address the vulnerability promptly. The dedicated team's availability and expertise allow for swift action and the implementation of effective security measures to protect the organization's systems and data. This priority attention and quality maintenance contribute to a proactive and robust security posture that aligns with the organization's specific needs and requirements.
