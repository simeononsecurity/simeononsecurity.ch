## Requirements to Transition from IT to Cybersecurity

To transition from IT to cybersecurity, several requirements must be fulfilled. These requirements include **education**, **experience**, **skills**, and **certifications**.

### Education Requirements

While a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, computer science, or a related field is not compulsory, it can enhance your employability. An associate degree or online courses can also provide valuable education and certifications. Platforms like [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) offer accessible and affordable learning opportunities from industry experts, allowing you to acquire in-demand security skills.

### Experience Requirements

Experience is critical in the cybersecurity field. Most entry-level cybersecurity positions require at least 3 to 5 years of experience. However, due to the skills gap, companies may be flexible with the experience requirements. Transitioning from IT to cybersecurity can provide an added advantage as general IT experience is still relevant. Internships and real-world experience through solving cybersecurity challenges independently or contributing to open-source projects can also help in gaining valuable experience.

### Skills Requirements

Employers look for specific **technical** and **non-technical** skills in cybersecurity professionals. Technical skills include coding in programming languages, system and network configuration and administration, digital forensics, incident response, and more. Non-technical skills such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and attention to detail are also crucial in the field. Technical skills can be learned through education and practical experience, while interpersonal skills need to be developed personally.

### Certification Requirements

Certifications play a significant role in validating your skills in the cybersecurity field. [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) is a recommended certification for those transitioning from IT to cybersecurity. There are also specialized certifications available based on your chosen specialization in cybersecurity. Obtaining relevant certifications can enhance your credibility and increase your chances of being hired.
