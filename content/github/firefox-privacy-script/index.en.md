FireFox Privacy Script

Organizations like [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config) and [ffprofile](https://ffprofile.com/) have suggested changes to make FireFox more secure and private.

This script will take the pregenerated FireFox configuration files and install them in the proper directories on a Windows system.
