A collection of WMI filters to assist with Windows Group Policy deployments

When deploying GPOs, Microsoft reccomends to use WMI filters to speed up the process and isolate policies in large domains. 
WMI Filters allow you to specify GPOs down to a specific piece of software or Windows version with the potential to get significantly much more complex.
The linked GitHub Repository includes some of the most commonly used WMI filters so that you don't have to create them.
