# Windows-Optimize-Debloat
For those who seek to minimize their Windows 10 installs.

**Download all the required files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Windows-Optimize-Debloat)**

## Introduction:
Windows 10 is an invasive and insecure operating system out of the box. 
Organizations like [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [PrivacyTools.io](https://PrivacyTools.io), and others have recommended configuration changes to optimize and debloat the Windows 10 operating system. These changes are include blocking telemetry, deleting logs, and removing bloatware to name a few. This script aims to automate the configurations recommended by those organizations.

## Notes: 
- This script is designed for operation in primarily **Personal Use** environments. 
- This script is designed in such a way that the optimizations, unlike some other scripts, will not break core windows functionality.
 - Features like Windows Update, Windows Defender, the Windows Store, and Cortona have been restricted, but are not in a disfunctional state like most other Windows 10 Privacy scripts.
- If you seek a minimized script targeted only to commercial environments, please see this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script)

## Requirements:
- [X] Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Professional, or Windows 10 Home
  - Windows 10 Home does not allow for GPO configurations.
    - Script will still work but not all settings will apply.
  - Windows 10 "N" Editions are not tested.
  - Currently Windows 10 **v1909**, **v2004**, or **20H2**. 
  - Run the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3159635/windows-10-update-assistant) to update and verify latest major release.
