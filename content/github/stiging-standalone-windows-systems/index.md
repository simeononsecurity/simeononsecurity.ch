# STIGing Standalone Windows 10 Systems

**Download all the required files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script)**

**We are seeking help with the following [.Net issue](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/W10-Optimize-and-Harden/issues/3)** 

## Introduction:

Windows 10 is insecure operating system out of the box and requires many changes to insure [FISMA](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act) compliance. 
Organizations like [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [Cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil), the [Department of Defense](https://dod.gov), and the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) have recommended and required configuration changes to lockdown, harden, and secure the operating system and ensure government compliance. These changes cover a wide range of mitigations including blocking telemetry, macros, removing bloatware, and preventing many physical attacks on a system.

Standalone systems are some of the most difficult and annoying systems to secure. When not automated, they require manual changes of each STIG/SRG. Totalling over 1000 configuration changes on a typical deployment and an average of 5 minutes per change equaling 3.5 days worth of work. This script aims to speed up that process significantly.

## Notes: 

- This script is designed for operation in **Enterprise** environments and assumes you have hardware support for all the requirements.
  - For personal systems please see this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/W10-Optimize-and-Harden)
- This script is not designed to bring a system to 100% compliance, rather it should be used as a stepping stone to complete most, if not all, the configuration changes that can be scripted. 
  - Minus system documentation, this collection should bring you up to about 95% compliance on all the STIGS/SRGs applied.

## Requirements:
- [X] Windows 10 Enterprise is **Required** per STIG.
- [x] [Standards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure) for a highly secure Windows 10 device

  - Currently Windows 10 **v1909** or **v2004**. 
  - Run the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3159635/windows-10-update-assistant) to be update and verify latest major release.
