Automate the .NET Framework STIG

Applying the .NET STIG is definitely not straightforward. For many administrators it can take hours to fully implement on a single system. This script applies the required registry changes and modifies the machine.config file to implement FIPS and other controls as required.

## Notes:

This script can not and will not ever get the .NET stig to 100% compliance. Right now, as is, it stands to complete roughly 75% of the checks and does go back and complete the applicable checks on all previous .NET versions.

Manual intervention is required for any .NET application or IIS Site.

## Requirements: 
- [X] Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 or newer
- [X] Testing in your environment before running on production systems. 

## STIGS/SRGs Applied:

- [Microsoft .Net Framework 4 V1R9](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_MS_DotNet_Framework_4-0_V1R9_STIG.zip)
