**Creating Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint 2.0 Hotspots on OpenWRT**

In today's connected world, providing seamless and secure Wi-Fi connectivity is essential for various industries and public spaces. One revolutionary technology that addresses this need is **Hotspot 2.0**, also known as **Passpoint 2.0**. In this guide, we will explore how to set up Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT, a popular open-source router and access point firmware.

## Introduction

{{< youtube id="bkryvh5QrkE" >}}

**Hotspot 2.0** brings enhanced security and convenience to Wi-Fi connectivity by automating the connection process and ensuring a secure exchange of credentials. Before diving into the technical details, let's address the key questions: What is Hotspot 2.0, and why is it crucial for modern Wi-Fi networks?

Hotspot 2.0, defined by the **IEEE 802.11u standard**, enables **seamless and secure Wi-Fi roaming** by allowing mobile devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks automatically. This technology eliminates the hassle of manually selecting and authenticating with each network, providing users with a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

## The Significance of Hotspot 2.0 and Passpoint 2.0

{{< youtube id="p4gDW6SJ150" >}}

### Enhancing User Experience

One of the main goals of **Hotspot 2.0** is to enhance the user experience when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. With Passpoint certification, smartphones can automatically identify and connect to Passpoint-certified access points. This eliminates the need for users to navigate through network lists and enter credentials manually.

### Security and Authentication

Hotspot 2.0 addresses security concerns by implementing robust authentication protocols. The Passpoint profile on a smartphone contains essential information, including **MCC-MNC (Mobile Country Code – Mobile Network Code)**, **NAI realm**, and **OI (Organization Identifier)**. These elements, along with login credentials, establish a secure connection to the service provider.

### Interoperability and Roaming

Passpoint profiles are not tied to specific SSIDs, allowing them to work across any WLAN with appropriate Passpoint configuration. This interoperability ensures a consistent and reliable connection experience, especially in environments with multiple access points.

## Implementing Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

### Prerequisites for Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

Before configuring Passpoint on OpenWrt, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- OpenWrt compatible device with a Passpoint-capable wireless device (PHY).
- OpenWrt 21.02, or newer, including `wpad` (hostapd) built with the `hs20` option.
- Full version of the `iw` package in OpenWrt.
- 802.1x infrastructure (RADIUS server).
- Information about the assigned RADIUS servers:
    - Server IP address
    - Port numbers
    - Shared secrets

> **Note:** This information can be obtained through an email or document through your provider. If you're using [Google Orion](https://orion.google/) like we are in our examples below, you'll be self hosting a [freeradius based radsec proxy](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/orion-radsec/tree/sos-dev). We won't be going into this in this article so **please read your providers instructions carefully**.

#### Overview of Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

Passpoint configuration on OpenWrt requires specific preparations and package installations. Here is an overview of the necessary steps:

1. **Check `wpad` for Hotspot 2.0 Capability:**
   
   Verify if `wpad` has Hotspot 2.0 capability by running the following command:

   ```bash
   strings /usr/sbin/wpad | grep hs20
   ```

   If nothing shows up, it indicates that `wpad` lacks Hotspot 2.0 support. In this case, the default package (`wpad-basic`) needs to be replaced with a full version, such as `wpad-openssl`. We have commands that will do this for you below.

2. **Hostapd Configuration with UCI:**

   Unlike manual editing of `hostapd.conf` on a Linux box, OpenWrt uses UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) to auto-generate the configuration. The shell script "/lib/netifd/hostapd.sh" generates "/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf" based on the wireless configuration file "/etc/config/wireless" in the UCI.

   Ensure the wireless configuration in "/etc/config/wireless" is correctly set up to align with Passpoint requirements.

By following these steps, you set up the necessary prerequisites and configurations for Passpoint on OpenWrt, enabling your device to support Hotspot 2.0 seamlessly.

- [GL.iNet GL-AX1800(Flint) WiFi 6 Router](https://amzn.to/3OWKTa2)
  - For some reason GL.iNet left this device on OpenWRT base 21.xx.xx rather than 22.xx.xx or 23.xx.xx like their other supported devices.
      - It's also using Linux/OpenWRT Kernel 4.4.60 which is very unusual.  
  - The GL.iNet latest image (Currently 4.5.0) repo is missing critical packages needed for HS20 Support. Specifically it is missing the `iw-full` package.
      - The workaround is to manually install the appropriate dependencies and the package manually.
      - [`libnl-tiny1`](https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.7/packages/arm_cortex-a7/base/libnl-tiny1_2020-08-05-c291088f-2_arm_cortex-a7.ipk)
      - [`iw-full`](https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.7/packages/arm_cortex-a7/base/iw-full_5.9-8fab0c9e-3_arm_cortex-a7.ipk)
      - Fix this issue by running the following command `wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.7/packages/arm_cortex-a7/base/libnl-tiny1_2020-08-05-c291088f-2_arm_cortex-a7.ipk && wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.7/packages/arm_cortex-a7/base/iw-full_5.9-8fab0c9e-3_arm_cortex-a7.ipk && opkg install --force-overwrite libnl-tiny1_2020-08-05-c291088f-2_arm_cortex-a7.ipk && opkg install --force-overwrite iw-full_5.9-8fab0c9e-3_arm_cortex-a7.ipk && opkg update && opkg install kmod-ath11k kmod-ath kmod-mac80211 kmod-cfg80211`

  - [OpenWRT Flashing instructions for the Cudy WR3000](https://openwrt.org/toh/cudy/wr3000_v1)
  - We Love it for the amazing performance. It's quite similar to GL.iNet's Flint and Flint 2 for less than half the cost.
  - Be sure to use Google Chrome when uploading firmware via the web gui.
  - You'll need to install a couple different packages run the following command after running the commands in the section below `opkg --force-overwrite install kmod-mt76x2u kmod-mt76-connac kmod-mt76-core kmod-mt76-usb kmod-mt76x2-common kmod-mt76x2u kmod-mt7915e kmod-mt7916-firmware mt7981-wo-firmware bridger` and `echo 'options mt7915e wed_enable=Y' >> /etc/modules.conf`
- [TP-Link EAP225-Outdoor](https://amzn.to/3I3qKv7)
  - [OpenWRT flashing instructions for the EAP225](https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/eap225)
    - This is going to be an advanced openwrt install, high likelyhood of bricking your device. **DO NOT ATTEMPT IF NOT SKILLED** 
  - We love it because it is the only OpenWRT compatible outdoor unit we could find with replaceable antennas.
  - Only WiFi 5 however. If you find something better for this purpose, please let us know!

### Updating OpenWRT Packages for Hotspot 2.0 Support on OpenWRT

> **Note:** ***Perform this section while hardwired into the device via ethernet, it will temporarily disable wifi.***

> **Note:** *These commands may uninstall other packages that have these as dependencies. If this happens, reinstall them after finishing this section.*

> **Note:** *These packages are touchy on their install order. If you get an error on your device. Try uninstalling everything mentioned and installing the error package first. You can do this from the command line or the software page in the Luci admin page.*

Before configuring Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT, ensure that your system has the required packages installed. 

Use the following commands to install necessary components:

```bash
opkg update && \
opkg --force-removal-of-dependent-packages remove iw iw-full gl-sdk4-repeater hostapd* wpad*  && \
opkg --force-overwrite --force-downgrade --force-removal-of-dependent-packages install wpad-openssl nano && \
opkg --force-overwrite --force-downgrade --force-removal-of-dependent-packages install iw-full hostapd-common && \
opkg --force-overwrite --force-removal-of-dependent-packages install kmod-mac80211 kmod-cfg80211
```

If you've purchased one of the [GL.iNet devices](https://amzn.to/3UnfDEw) we recommended above you'll also run the following command:

```bash
opkg --force-overwrite install kmod-ath10k-smallbuffers kmod-ath9k kmod-ath9k-common kmod-ath
```

Afterwards we need to run two commands:

#### Fixing 3GPP Bug for Hotspot 2.0 Support on OpenWRT

OpenWRT doesn't configure `hostapd` directly. It uses a script at `/lib/netifd/hostapd.sh` to convert your config at `/etc/config/wireless` to the appropriate `hostapd` config. On some distros of OpenWRT there is a bug that prevents 3GPP configurations. 

Run the following command on your device to resolve it:

```bash
sed -i '/append_iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net() {/,/}/c\
append_iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net() {\
    if [ -z "$iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf" ]; then\
        iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf="$1";\
    else\
        iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf="$iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf;$1";\
    fi\
}' /lib/netifd/hostapd.sh
```

> *Just one character is the issue. The script above is fine to run on all devices. It won't make any changes if the bug isn't there.*

#### Testing Hotspot 2.0 Functionality on OpenWRT

After configuring your interface and performing the 3gpp fix, you'll run the following command to **reload your wireless config**:

```bash
wifi
```
Then verify that the interface becomes available:

```bash
iwinfo
```
Example:

```bash
phy0-ap0  ESSID: "OrionWiFi"
          Access Point: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
          Mode: Master  Channel: 6 (2.437 GHz)  HT Mode: HE20

          Tx-Power: 30 dBm  Link Quality: 54/70
          Signal: -56 dBm  Noise: -92 dBm
          Bit Rate: 689.1 MBit/s
          Encryption: WPA2 802.1X (CCMP)
          Type: nl80211  HW Mode(s): 802.11ac/ax/n
          Hardware: embedded [MediaTek MT7986]
          TX power offset: none
          Frequency offset: none
          Supports VAPs: yes  PHY name: phy1
```

##### Verifying Hotspot 2.0 Client Capability on Windows

To see whether Passpoint is supported by your Wi-Fi device on Windows 10/11, verify if "ANQP Service Information Discovery" is "Supported", using the following command:

```batch
netsh wlan show wirelesscapabilities
```


### OpenWRT Wireless Config Options Explained

#### Access Network Type

Configure the Access Network Type using the following format:

| Access Network Type | Description                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0                   | Private network                       |
| 1                   | Private network with guest access     |
| 2                   | Chargeable public network             |
| 3                   | Free public network                   |
| 4                   | Personal device network               |
| 5                   | Emergency services only network       |
| 14                  | Test or experimental                  |
| 15                  | Wildcard                              |

**Explanation**:

- The 'Access Network Type' specifies the nature of the network, helping devices categorize and interact appropriately.
- Choose the appropriate number to define the desired network type.

##### Example Usage:

To set the Access Network Type to 'Chargeable public network':

```bash
option iw_access_network_type '2'
```

This example illustrates how to configure the Access Network Type. Adjust the value based on the characteristics of your network.

Configuring the Access Network Type provides crucial information about the nature of the network, aiding devices in understanding the available services and connectivity options.

|      0       |    Address type not available     |
|      1       |      Address type available       |
|      2       | Availability of the address type not known |

**Explanation**:

- The configuration format involves a 1-octet encoded value as a hexadecimal string.
- For IPv4 type, it combines bits using bitwise operations to represent the type of IPv4 address availability.
- For IPv6 type, it represents the availability of the address type.

**Example Usage**: 

```bash
option iw_ipaddr_type_availability '11'
```

This example sets IP Address Type Availability with IPv4 type available and IPv6 type available. Adjust the values based on your specific requirements.

This configuration informs the system that both public IPv4 and available IPv6 addresses can be used. The '11' is a combination of the binary representation for IPv4 availability (01) and IPv6 availability (01).

### Troubleshooting OpenWRT and Best Practices for Hotspot 2.0

#### Hostapd Configuration Checks

Before delving into troubleshooting, it's crucial to perform thorough checks on the Hostapd configuration. Start by examining the configuration file located at `/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf` for any errors or inconsistencies. Use the following command to review the specific configuration file for a particular interface:

```bash
cat /var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf | grep bssid
```

Ensure that the MAC address specified in the configuration matches the actual MAC address of the wireless interface. Verify this by checking the MAC address in both `/sys/class/ieee80211/phyX/macaddress` and `/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf`.

#### Debugging Hostapd Execution

When encountering issues, it's beneficial to run Hostapd in debug mode to gather detailed information about the initialization process. Execute the following commands for the respective interfaces, replacing `X` with the appropriate interface number:

```bash
hostapd -dddd -B -P /var/run/hostapd-phyX.pid /var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf
```
Examine the debug output for any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into the cause of the problem.

#### Luci Configuration Page

If the wireless interface fails to start, the Luci configuration page offers a convenient way to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Follow these steps:

1. Access the Luci web interface.
2. Navigate to the configuration page for the problematic wireless interface.
3. Disable the `proxyarp` option, save the configuration changes.
4. Click "Save & Apply"

Check the system logs using `logread` for any error messages during this reconfiguration phase.

> **Note:** *We understand that per spec that proxyarp should be left on if at all possible. However, we did have a number of OpenWRT devices have issues with this.*

#### Channel and Power Level Settings

Some devices and radios may require specific channel and power level configurations for optimal performance. Verify that the channel and power settings align with the hardware specifications of your wireless device. Incorrect settings can lead to interface startup failures.
