**Creating Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint 2.0 Hotspots on OpenWRT**

In today's connected world, providing seamless and secure Wi-Fi connectivity is essential for various industries and public spaces. One revolutionary technology that addresses this need is **Hotspot 2.0**, also known as **Passpoint 2.0**. In this article, we will explore how to set up Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT, a popular open-source router and access point firmware.

## Introduction

**Hotspot 2.0** brings enhanced security and convenience to Wi-Fi connectivity by automating the connection process and ensuring a secure exchange of credentials. Before diving into the technical details, let's address the key questions: What is Hotspot 2.0, and why is it crucial for modern Wi-Fi networks?

Hotspot 2.0, defined by the **IEEE 802.11u standard**, enables **seamless and secure Wi-Fi roaming** by allowing mobile devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks automatically. This technology eliminates the hassle of manually selecting and authenticating with each network, providing users with a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

## The Significance of Hotspot 2.0 and Passpoint 2.0

### Enhancing User Experience

One of the main goals of **Hotspot 2.0** is to enhance the user experience when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. With Passpoint certification, smartphones can automatically identify and connect to Passpoint-certified access points. This eliminates the need for users to navigate through network lists and enter credentials manually.

### Security and Authentication

Hotspot 2.0 addresses security concerns by implementing robust authentication protocols. The Passpoint profile on a smartphone contains essential information, including **MCC-MNC (Mobile Country Code â€“ Mobile Network Code)**, **NAI realm**, and **OI (Organization Identifier)**. These elements, along with login credentials, establish a secure connection to the service provider.

### Interoperability and Roaming

Passpoint profiles are not tied to specific SSIDs, allowing them to work across any WLAN with appropriate Passpoint configuration. This interoperability ensures a consistent and reliable connection experience, especially in environments with multiple access points.

## Implementing Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

### Prerequisites for Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

Before configuring Passpoint on OpenWrt, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- OpenWrt compatible device with a Passpoint-capable wireless device (PHY).
- OpenWrt 21.02, or newer, including `wpad` (hostapd) built with the `hs20` option.
- Full version of the `iw` package in OpenWrt.
- 802.1x infrastructure (RADIUS server).
- Information about the assigned RADIUS servers:
    - Server IP address
    - Port numbers
    - Shared secrets

> **Note:** This information can be obtained through an email or document through your provider. If you're using [Google Orion](https://orion.google/) like we are in our examples below, you'll be self hosting a [freeradius based radsec proxy](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/orion-radsec/tree/sos-dev). We won't be going into this in this article so **please read your providers instructions carefully**.

#### Overview of Hotspot 2.0 on OpenWRT

Passpoint configuration on OpenWrt requires specific preparations and package installations. Here is an overview of the necessary steps:

1. **Check `wpad` for Hotspot 2.0 Capability:**
   
   Verify if `wpad` has Hotspot 2.0 capability by running the following command:

   ```bash
   strings /usr/sbin/wpad | grep hs20
   ```

   If nothing shows up, it indicates that `wpad` lacks Hotspot 2.0 support. In this case, the default package (`wpad-basic`) needs to be replaced with a full version, such as `wpad-openssl`. We have commands that will do this for you below.

2. **Hostapd Configuration with UCI:**

   Unlike manual editing of `hostapd.conf` on a Linux box, OpenWrt uses UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) to auto-generate the configuration. The shell script "/lib/netifd/hostapd.sh" generates "/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf" based on the wireless configuration file "/etc/config/wireless" in the UCI.

   Ensure the wireless configuration in "/etc/config/wireless" is correctly set up to align with Passpoint requirements.

By following these steps, you set up the necessary prerequisites and configurations for Passpoint on OpenWrt, enabling your device to support Hotspot 2.0 seamlessly.

Afterwards we need to run two commands:

#### Fixing 3GPP Bug for Hotspot 2.0 Support on OpenWRT

OpenWRT doesn't configure `hostapd` directly. It uses a script at `/lib/netifd/hostapd.sh` to convert your config at `/etc/config/wireless` to the appropriate `hostapd` config. On some distros of OpenWRT there is a bug that prevents 3GPP configurations. 

Run the following command on your device to resolve it:

```bash
sed -i '/append_iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net() {/,/}/c\
append_iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net() {\
    if [ -z "$iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf" ]; then\
        iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf="$1";\
    else\
        iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf="$iw_anqp_3gpp_cell_net_conf;$1";\
    fi\
}' /lib/netifd/hostapd.sh
```

> *Just one character is the issue. The script above is fine to run on all devices. It won't make any changes if the bug isn't there.*

After configuring your interface and performing the 3gpp fix, you'll run the following command to **reload your wireless config**.

```bash
wifi
```
### OpenWRT Wireless Config Options Explained


### Access Network Type

Configure the Access Network Type using the following format:

| Access Network Type | Description                           |

| 0                   | Private network                       |
| 1                   | Private network with guest access     |
| 2                   | Chargeable public network             |
| 3                   | Free public network                   |
| 4                   | Personal device network               |
| 5                   | Emergency services only network       |
| 14                  | Test or experimental                  |
| 15                  | Wildcard                              |

**Explanation**:

- The 'Access Network Type' specifies the nature of the network, helping devices categorize and interact appropriately.
- Choose the appropriate number to define the desired network type.

##### Example Usage:

To set the Access Network Type to 'Chargeable public network':

```bash
option iw_access_network_type '2'
```

This example illustrates how to configure the Access Network Type. Adjust the value based on the characteristics of your network.

Configuring the Access Network Type provides crucial information about the nature of the network, aiding devices in understanding the available services and connectivity options.

#### Venue Info (Optional)

Configure Venue Information using the following format:

> **Group, Type**

##### Values:

|  Group  |  Type  |                Description               |
|:-------:|:------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|    0    |    0   |                 Unspecified                |
|    1    |    7   |             Convention Center             |
|    1    |   13   |                Coffee Shop                 |
|    2    |    0   |         Unspecified Business              |
|    7    |    1   |           Private Residence               |

**Explanation**:

- Venue Information allows you to specify the group and type based on IEEE Std 802.11u-2011, 7.3.1.34.
- The 'Group' parameter represents a broader category, while 'Type' specifies the specific venue type within that group.

##### Example Usage:

- To set the Venue Group to 'Convention Center':
```plaintext
option iw_venue_group '1'
```
- To set the Venue Type to 'Coffee Shop':
```plaintext
option iw_venue_type '13'
```

These examples demonstrate how to configure Venue Information. Adjust the values according to your specific venue details.

This configuration provides additional information about the network, helping devices identify and connect based on the specified venue characteristics.

#### NAI Realm Information

One or more realms can be advertised, with each `nai_realm` line adding a new realm to the set. These parameters provide information for stations using Interworking network selection to facilitate automatic connection to a network based on credentials.

> Format: `<Encoding>,<NAI Realm(s)>[,<EAP Method 1>][,<EAP Method 2>][,...]`

##### Encoding

Choose the encoding format for the realm. The following options are available:

| Realm Format | Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | Realm formatted in accordance with IETF RFC 4282           |
| 1            | UTF-8 formatted character string not following RFC 4282  |

**NAI Realm(s): Semi-colon delimited NAI Realm(s)**

> EAP Method: `<EAP Method>[:<[AuthParam1:Val1]>][<[AuthParam2:Val2]>][...]`

For EAP Method types, refer to [AuthParam (Table 8-188 in IEEE Std 802.11-2012)](http://www.iana.org/assignments/eap-numbers/eap-numbers.xhtml#eap-numbers-4).

**ID 2 = Non-EAP Inner Authentication Type**

|  ID  |      Authentication Type     |
|:----:|:-----------------------------:|

|   3  | NFC Secure Element                |
|   4  |          Hardware Token          |
|   5  |            Softoken              |
|   6  |            Certificate           |
|   7  |      Username/Password           |
|   9  |            Anonymous              |
|  10  |       Vendor Specific             |

**Examples:**

- `list iw_nai_realm '0,example.com;example.net'`
- `list iw_nai_realm '0,example.org,13[5:6],21[2:4][5:7]'`

These examples demonstrate configuring EAP methods such as EAP-TLS with a certificate and EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2 with a username/password. Adjust the parameters based on your specific requirements.

#### WAN Metrics (Optional)

Configure WAN Metrics using the following format:

> `<WAN Info>:<DL Speed>:<UL Speed>:<DL Load>:<UL Load>:<LMD>`

**WAN Info**: B0-B1: Link Status, B2: Symmetric Link, B3: Capability (encoded as two hex digits)

- **Link Status**: 1 = Link up, 2 = Link down, 3 = Link in test state

- **Downlink Speed**: Estimate of WAN backhaul link current downlink speed in kbps (1..4294967295; 0 = unknown)

- **Uplink Speed**: Estimate of WAN backhaul link current uplink speed in kbps (1..4294967295; 0 = unknown)

- **Downlink Load**: Current load of downlink WAN connection (scaled to 255 = 100%)

- **Uplink Load**: Current load of uplink WAN connection (scaled to 255 = 100%)

- **Load Measurement Duration**: Duration for measuring downlink/uplink load in tenths of a second (1..65535); 0 if load cannot be determined

**Example**: 

```bash
option hs20_wan_metrics '01:8000:1000:80:240:3000'
```

This example sets WAN Metrics with link status up, downlink speed of 8000 kbps, uplink speed of 1000 kbps, 80% downlink load, 24% uplink load, and a load measurement duration of 3000 tenths of a second. Adjust the values based on your specific WAN characteristics.

#### IP Address Type Availability

Configure IP Address Type Availability using the following format:

> `<1-octet encoded value as hex str>` 
`((ipv4_type & 0x3f) << 2) | (ipv6_type & 0x3)`

##### ipv4 type:

|  IPv4 Type  |             Description            |
|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|      0       |    Address type not available     |
|      1       |    Public IPv4 address available  |
|      2       | Port-restricted IPv4 address available  |
|      3       | Single NATed private IPv4 address available |
|      4       | Double NATed private IPv4 address available |
|      5       | Port-restricted IPv4 address and single NATed IPv4 address available |
|      6       | Port-restricted IPv4 address and double NATed IPv4 address available |
|      7       | Availability of the address type is not known |

##### ipv6 type:

|  IPv6 Type  |             Description            |
|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|      0       |    Address type not available     |
|      1       |      Address type available       |
|      2       | Availability of the address type not known |

**Explanation**:

- The configuration format involves a 1-octet encoded value as a hexadecimal string.
- For IPv4 type, it combines bits using bitwise operations to represent the type of IPv4 address availability.
- For IPv6 type, it represents the availability of the address type.

**Example Usage**: 

```bash
option iw_ipaddr_type_availability '11'
```

This example sets IP Address Type Availability with IPv4 type available and IPv6 type available. Adjust the values based on your specific requirements.

This configuration informs the system that both public IPv4 and available IPv6 addresses can be used. The '11' is a combination of the binary representation for IPv4 availability (01) and IPv6 availability (01).

### Troubleshooting OpenWRT and Best Practices for Hotspot 2.0

#### Hostapd Configuration Checks

Before delving into troubleshooting, it's crucial to perform thorough checks on the Hostapd configuration. Start by examining the configuration file located at `/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf` for any errors or inconsistencies. Use the following command to review the specific configuration file for a particular interface:

```bash
cat /var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf | grep bssid
```

Ensure that the MAC address specified in the configuration matches the actual MAC address of the wireless interface. Verify this by checking the MAC address in both `/sys/class/ieee80211/phyX/macaddress` and `/var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf`.

#### Debugging Hostapd Execution

When encountering issues, it's beneficial to run Hostapd in debug mode to gather detailed information about the initialization process. Execute the following commands for the respective interfaces, replacing `X` with the appropriate interface number:

```bash
hostapd -dddd -B -P /var/run/hostapd-phyX.pid /var/run/hostapd-phyX.conf
```
Examine the debug output for any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into the cause of the problem.

#### Luci Configuration Page

If the wireless interface fails to start, the Luci configuration page offers a convenient way to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Follow these steps:

1. Access the Luci web interface.
2. Navigate to the configuration page for the problematic wireless interface.
3. Disable the `proxyarp` option, save the configuration changes.
4. Click "Save & Apply"

Check the system logs using `logread` for any error messages during this reconfiguration phase.

> **Note:** *We understand that per spec that proxyarp should be left on if at all possible. However, we did have a number of OpenWRT devices have issues with this.*

#### Channel and Power Level Settings

Some devices and radios may require specific channel and power level configurations for optimal performance. Verify that the channel and power settings align with the hardware specifications of your wireless device. Incorrect settings can lead to interface startup failures.

Always consult the device documentation or specifications to determine the recommended channel and power level configurations. Adjust the settings accordingly in the wireless configuration file or luci interface.

By meticulously examining these aspects and following the outlined steps, you can troubleshoot common issues associated with Hostapd and enhance the stability of your Hotspot 2.0 implementation.
