## List of Valid “guest_os_type” Values for vSphere Packer Builder

**VMware vSphere** is a powerful virtualization platform that allows users to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) in their data centers. Packer, a popular open-source tool developed by HashiCorp, enables users to automate the creation of VM images for various platforms, including vSphere. When using Packer with vSphere, one important configuration is the **"guest_os_type"** value, which specifies the type of guest operating system to be installed on the VM.

In this article, we will explore the **valid "guest_os_type"** values for vSphere Packer Builder, along with their significance and use cases. This information will be valuable for system administrators, DevOps professionals, and anyone working with VMware vSphere and Packer.

## Introduction to VMware vSphere Packer Builder

Before we delve into the list of valid "guest_os_type" values, let's briefly discuss the VMware vSphere Packer Builder. Packer Builder is a plugin for Packer that allows users to create VM images for VMware vSphere. It enables automation, consistency, and repeatability in the process of creating virtual machine images, making it a preferred choice for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) workflows.

With Packer Builder, you can define a VM template with pre-configured settings, including the **"guest_os_type"**. The guest OS type helps vSphere identify the operating system being installed, allowing it to apply specific configurations and optimizations for that OS.

______

## Understanding the "guest_os_type" Value

The **"guest_os_type"** value is a crucial parameter when building VM images using Packer for vSphere. It defines the guest operating system that will be installed on the VM. It's important to set this value correctly to ensure that vSphere applies the appropriate configurations and settings for the intended OS.

The **"guest_os_type"** is specified in the Packer template file in the following format:

```
"guest_os_type": "value"
```
or in the packer vsphere builder
```
vm_guest_os_type: "value"
```


Now, let's explore the **list of valid "guest_os_type"** values along with their descriptions and use cases.
