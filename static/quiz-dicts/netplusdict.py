        "correctanswer": "a",
        "reasoning": "To convert the subnet mask 255.255.255.224 to binary, we need to convert each octet to its binary equivalent. 255 in binary is 11111111, and 224 in binary is 11100000. Therefore, the binary equivalent of the subnet mask 255.255.255.224 is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000.",

        "correctanswer": "b",
        "reasoning": "To support 14 subnets, we need 4 bits (2^4 = 16) and to support 70 hosts, we need 7 bits (2^7 = 128). Therefore, the subnet mask is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000, which is equivalent to 255.255.255.224.",

        "correctanswer": "c",
        "reasoning": "The network address 192.168.10.0/24 has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which provides 8 bits for subnetting. The formula to calculate the number of subnets is 2^s (s being the number of subnet bits), which in this case is 2^8 = 256. However, one subnet is reserved as the network address, and one subnet is reserved as the broadcast address, so the maximum number of usable subnets is 256 - 2 = 254.",

        "reasoning": "A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 uses 24 bits for the network portion of the address, leaving 8 bits for the host portion. Therefore, answer b (8) is correct.",
