What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
Today, SimeonOnSecurity came across two interesting and useful security and privacy related tools: Universal Android Debloater and DeepPrivacy.
The Universal Android Debloater is a bash script using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to debloat non-rooted Android devices. This tool can help to improve privacy, security and battery life of your device by removing unwanted apps and bloatware. You can find the Universal Android Debloater at https://gitlab.</description></item></channel></rss>
