&lt;p>&lt;strong>What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SimeonOnSecurity has updated a page on his website and learned about a few resources that he finds interesting. The updated page is the writeup for the Invite Challenge on HackTheBox. This page provides an in-depth analysis of the process of solving the challenge on both Windows and Linux systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the updated page, SimeonOnSecurity also discovered some useful learning resources. One of these resources is a blog post by Cameron Nokes that focuses on working with JSON in bash using the jq tool. The jq tool is a command-line utility that makes it easy to parse, filter, and manipulate JSON data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
