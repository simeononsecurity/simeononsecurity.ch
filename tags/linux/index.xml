This article provides a list of recommended anti-virus products for home and business use, as ranked by SimeonOnSecurity. The rankings are based on professional opinion and testing against malicious samples, and only cover anti-virus capabilities, detection, user experience, and performance. Windows users can choose from both paid and free options, while Linux and MacOS users have limited options, with paid options only available for Linux. Note that AV is not required on Linux or MacOS and using any VPN or password manager provided with the AV suite is not recommended. The article also provides recommendations for VPN providers. Business use recommendations are currently being worked on.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Certifications</title><link>https://simeononsecurity.ch/recommendations/certifications/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><category>
