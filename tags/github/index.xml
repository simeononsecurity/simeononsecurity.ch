What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and automation using Ansible.
First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Windows_STIG_Ansible repository provides a complete solution for configuring Windows systems to meet Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, using the Ansible automation platform. The windows_stigs repository is a collection of Ansible roles for configuring Windows systems to meet STIG requirements, and it is available on Ansible Galaxy, a central repository for sharing Ansible content.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learned How to Manipulate and Parse JSON in PowerShell and Bash</title><link>https://dev.simeononsecurity.ch/til/2021-02-17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SimeonOnSecurity</dc:creator><category>
