&lt;p>&lt;strong>What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and automation using Ansible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Windows_STIG_Ansible repository provides a complete solution for configuring Windows systems to meet Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, using the Ansible automation platform. The windows_stigs repository is a collection of Ansible roles for configuring Windows systems to meet STIG requirements, and it is available on Ansible Galaxy, a central repository for sharing Ansible content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Today I Learned about Auditpol, Sysmon, and Sysmon Configurations</title><link>https://simeononsecurity.com/til/2021-05-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category>

&lt;p>SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and event monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Automate-Sysmon repository provides a solution for automating the installation, configuration, and management of Sysmon, a popular tool for monitoring and logging system activity on Windows systems. The Windows-Audit-Policy repository provides a solution for automating the configuration of Windows audit policies, which control the auditing of various security-related events on Windows systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Today I Learned How to Manipulate and Parse JSON in PowerShell and Bash</title><link>https://simeononsecurity.com/til/2021-02-17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SimeonOnSecurity has updated a page on his website and learned about a few resources that he finds interesting. The updated page is the writeup for the Invite Challenge on HackTheBox. This page provides an in-depth analysis of the process of solving the challenge on both Windows and Linux systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the updated page, SimeonOnSecurity also discovered some useful learning resources. One of these resources is a blog post by Cameron Nokes that focuses on working with JSON in bash using the jq tool. The jq tool is a command-line utility that makes it easy to parse, filter, and manipulate JSON data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
