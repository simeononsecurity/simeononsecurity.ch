What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and automation using Ansible.
First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Windows_STIG_Ansible repository provides a complete solution for configuring Windows systems to meet Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) requirements, using the Ansible automation platform. The windows_stigs repository is a collection of Ansible roles for configuring Windows systems to meet STIG requirements, and it is available on Ansible Galaxy, a central repository for sharing Ansible content.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learned about Auditpol, Sysmon, and Sysmon Configurations</title><link>https://dev.simeononsecurity.ch/til/2021-05-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SimeonOnSecurity</dc:creator><category>

What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity learned and discovered several interesting things today related to Windows security and event monitoring.
First, two new and updated repositories were identified. The Automate-Sysmon repository provides a solution for automating the installation, configuration, and management of Sysmon, a popular tool for monitoring and logging system activity on Windows systems. The Windows-Audit-Policy repository provides a solution for automating the configuration of Windows audit policies, which control the auditing of various security-related events on Windows systems.</description></item><item><title>Today I Learned How to Manipulate and Parse JSON in PowerShell and Bash</title><link>https://dev.simeononsecurity.ch/til/2021-02-17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">SimeonOnSecurity</dc:creator><category>

What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity has updated a page on his website and learned about a few resources that he finds interesting. The updated page is the writeup for the Invite Challenge on HackTheBox. This page provides an in-depth analysis of the process of solving the challenge on both Windows and Linux systems.
In addition to the updated page, SimeonOnSecurity also discovered some useful learning resources. One of these resources is a blog post by Cameron Nokes that focuses on working with JSON in bash using the jq tool.</description></item></channel></rss>
