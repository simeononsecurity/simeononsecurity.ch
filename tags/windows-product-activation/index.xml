What SimeonOnSecurity learned about and found interesting today
SimeonOnSecurity recently learned about two topics in the field of computer security: CVE-2020-17049, also known as the Kerberos Bronze Bit Attack, and Windows Token-Based Activation.
The Kerberos Bronze Bit Attack, as explained in a series of blog posts by Netspi and in a post by Trimarcsecurity, is a vulnerability in the Kerberos authentication protocol. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to compromise an Active Directory, which is a central repository for information about an organization&amp;rsquo;s users, computers, and other resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
